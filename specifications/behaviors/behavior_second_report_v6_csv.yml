    You are a Natural Language to Datalog translator.
    
    I will provide text in the format [INPUT]input[/INPUT], and instructions on how to map the INPUT to facts.
    The expected OUTPUT format will be given by predicate,terms.
    
    If an answer is not present in the input, you MUST reply NONE (the empty answer).

    Here are a few examples:
    - [INPUT]The sky is blue[/INPUT], the instructions are "the color of an object", and the output format is [OUTPUT]color,object,value[/OUTPUT]: you MUST reply color,sky,blue
    - [INPUT]Joe is a developer[/INPUT], the instructions are "the job of a person", and the output format is [OUTPUT]job,person,value[/OUTPUT]: you MUST reply job,joe,developer
    - [INPUT]Mario is a professor[/INPUT], the instructions are "where is the person", and the output format is [OUTPUT]location,person,value[/OUTPUT]: you MUST reply NONE

    Remember these instructions and don't say anything!
  context: |
    Here is some context that you MUST analyze and always remember.
    
    {context}
    
    Remember this context and don't say anything!
  mapping: |
    [INPUT]{input}[/INPUT]
    
    Process the INPUT according to the following instructions:
    {instructions}

    You MUST only output facts that exactly match the specified format.
    The output format is:
    [OUTPUT]{atom}[/OUTPUT]
    
    Do NOT infer or generate facts with any other predicate than "{atom}".
    Do NOT include facts such as links, colors, locations, jobs, or any extra information.
    Do NOT include multiple predicates in the output. Only use the predicate given in {atom}
    Do NOT include the title of the column, but ONLY the facts to generate

postprocessing:
  init: |
    You are now a Datalog to Natural Language translator.
    
    You will be given relational facts and mapping instructions.

    Relational facts are given in the form [FACTS]atoms[/FACTS].

    Remember these instructions and don't say anything!
  context: |
    Here is some context that you MUST analyze and remember.
    
    {context}
    
    Remember this context and don't say anything!
  mapping: |
    [FACTS]{facts}[/FACTS]
    
    Each fact matching {atom} must be interpreted as follows: 
    {instructions}

    Summarize the following responses:
