The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions.

To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.", "format": "The fields of a quadratic NxN-labyrinth are provided by instances of predicate \"field\" as follows:\nfield(1,1). field(1,2). ... field(1,N). field(2,1). field(2,2). ... field(2,N). ... field(N,1). field(N,2). ... field(N,N).\n\nThe starting and the goal field are specified by exactly one instance of \"init_on\" and exactly one instance of \"goal_on\":\ninit_on(x_i,y_i). goal_on(x_g,y_g).\n\nIt always holds that 1 ≤ x_i,y_i,x_g,y_g ≤ N.\nThe connections of fields are given by instances of \"connect\" looking as follows: connect(x,y,d).\n\nAgain, we have 1 ≤ x,y ≤ N.

The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa.

description between triple backtips: \n ```Ravensburger's Labyrinth game deals with guiding an avatar through a dynamically changing labyrinth to certain fields. The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```The fields of a quadratic NxN-labyrinth are provided by instances of predicate \"field\" as follows:\nfield(1,1). field(1,2). ... field(1,N). field(2,1). field(2,2). ... field(2,N). ... field(N,1). field(N,2). ... field(N,N).\n\nThe starting and the goal field are specified by exactly one instance of \"init_on\" and exactly one instance of \"goal_on\":\ninit_on(x_i,y_i). goal_on(x_g,y_g).\n\nIt always holds that 1 ≤ x_i,y_i,x_g,y_g ≤ N.\nThe connections of fields are given by instances of \"connect\" looking as follows: connect(x,y,d).\n\nAgain, we have 1 ≤ x,y ≤ N.

The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.", "format": "The fields of a quadratic NxN-labyrinth are provided by instances of predicate \"field\" as follows:\nfield(1,1). field(1,2). ... field(1,N). field(2,1). field(2,2). ... field(2,N). ... field(N,1). field(N,2). ... field(N,N).\n\nThe starting and the goal field are specified by exactly one instance of \"init_on\" and exactly one instance of \"goal_on\":\ninit_on(x_i,y_i). goal_on(x_g,y_g).\n\nIt always holds that 1 ≤ x_i,y_i,x_g,y_g ≤ N.\nThe connections of fields are given by instances of \"connect\" looking as follows: connect(x,y,d).\n\nAgain, we have 1 ≤ x,y ≤ N.

The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```The fields of a quadratic NxN-labyrinth are provided by instances of predicate \"field\" as follows:\nfield(1,1). field(1,2). ... field(1,N). field(2,1). field(2,2). ... field(2,N). ... field(N,1). field(N,2). ... field(N,N).\n\nThe starting and the goal field are specified by exactly one instance of \"init_on\" and exactly one instance of \"goal_on\":\ninit_on(x_i,y_i). goal_on(x_g,y_g).\n\nIt always holds that 1 ≤ x_i,y_i,x_g,y_g ≤ N.\nThe connections of fields are given by instances of \"connect\" looking as follows: connect(x,y,d).\n\nAgain, we have 1 ≤ x,y ≤ N. Furthermore, direction d can be \"n\" for north, \"s\" for south, \"e\" for east, or \"w\" for west.\nFinally, the maximum number of pushes is determined by exactly one instance of \"max_steps\": max_steps(m).\n\nArgument m is a positive integer. An exemplary input for the above example looks as follows:\nfield(1,1). ... field(1,4). .... field(4,1). ... field(4,4). init_on(3,2). goal_on(1,4). connect(1,1,s). connect(1,1,w). connect(1,2,n). connect(1,2,e). connect(1,2,w). connect(1,3,e). connect(1,4,n). connect(1,4,w). ... connect(4,4,w). max_steps(2).```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```The starting field is at (14,6).

The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.", "format": "The fields of a quadratic NxN-labyrinth are provided by instances of predicate \"field\" as follows:\nfield(1,1). field(1,2). ... field(1,N). field(2,1). field(2,2). ... field(2,N). ... field(N,1). field(N,2). ... field(N,N).\n\nThe starting and the goal field are specified by exactly one instance of \"init_on\" and exactly one instance of \"goal_on\":\ninit_on(x_i,y_i). goal_on(x_g,y_g).\n\nIt always holds that 1 ≤ x_i,y_i,x_g,y_g ≤ N.\nThe connections of fields are given by instances of \"connect\" looking as follows: connect(x,y,d).\n\nAgain, we have 1 ≤ x,y ≤ N.

```Ravensburger's Labyrinth game deals with guiding an avatar through a dynamically changing labyrinth to certain fields. The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```The fields of a quadratic NxN-labyrinth are provided by instances of predicate \"field\" as follows:\nfield(1,1). field(1,2). ... field(1,N). field(2,1). field(2,2). ... field(2,N). ... field(N,1). field(N,2). ... field(N,N).\n\nThe starting and the goal field are specified by exactly one instance of \"init_on\" and exactly one instance of \"goal_on\":\ninit_on(x_i,y_i). goal_on(x_g,y_g).\n\nIt always holds that 1 ≤ x_i,y_i,x_g,y_g ≤ N.\nThe connections of fields are given by instances of \"connect\" looking as follows: connect(x,y,d).\n\nAgain, we have 1 ≤ x,y ≤ N. Furthermore, direction d can be \"n\" for north, \"s\" for south, \"e\" for east, or \"w\" for west.\nFinally, the maximum number of pushes is determined by exactly one instance of \"max_steps\": max_steps(m).\n\nArgument m is a positive integer. An exemplary input for the above example looks as follows:\nfield(1,1). ... field(1,4). .... field(4,1). ... field(4,4). init_on(3,2). goal_on(1,4). connect(1,1,s). connect(1,1,w). connect(1,2,n). connect(1,2,e). connect(1,2,w). connect(1,3,e). connect(1,4,n). connect(1,4,w). ... connect(4,4,w). max_steps(2).```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```The following fields have connections to the west: (1, 1), (1, 11), (1, 12), (1, 15), (1, 19), (1, 2), (1, 20), (1, 22).

The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.", "format": "The fields of a quadratic NxN-labyrinth are provided by instances of predicate \"field\" as follows:\nfield(1,1). field(1,2). ... field(1,N). field(2,1). field(2,2). ... field(2,N). ... field(N,1). field(N,2). ... field(N,N).\n\nThe starting and the goal field are specified by exactly one instance of \"init_on\" and exactly one instance of \"goal_on\":\ninit_on(x_i,y_i). goal_on(x_g,y_g).\n\nIt always holds that 1 ≤ x_i,y_i,x_g,y_g ≤ N.\nThe connections of fields are given by instances of \"connect\" looking as follows: connect(x,y,d).\n\nAgain, we have 1 ≤ x,y ≤ N.

problem description between triple backtips: \n ```Ravensburger's Labyrinth game deals with guiding an avatar through a dynamically changing labyrinth to certain fields. The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```The fields of a quadratic NxN-labyrinth are provided by instances of predicate \"field\" as follows:\nfield(1,1). field(1,2). ... field(1,N). field(2,1). field(2,2). ... field(2,N). ... field(N,1). field(N,2). ... field(N,N).\n\nThe starting and the goal field are specified by exactly one instance of \"init_on\" and exactly one instance of \"goal_on\":\ninit_on(x_i,y_i). goal_on(x_g,y_g).\n\nIt always holds that 1 ≤ x_i,y_i,x_g,y_g ≤ N.\nThe connections of fields are given by instances of \"connect\" looking as follows: connect(x,y,d).\n\nAgain, we have 1 ≤ x,y ≤ N. Furthermore, direction d can be \"n\" for north, \"s\" for south, \"e\" for east, or \"w\" for west.\nFinally, the maximum number of pushes is determined by exactly one instance of \"max_steps\": max_steps(m).\n\nArgument m is a positive integer. An exemplary input for the above example looks as follows:\nfield(1,1). ... field(1,4). .... field(4,1). ... field(4,4). init_on(3,2). goal_on(1,4). connect(1,1,s). connect(1,1,w). connect(1,2,n). connect(1,2,e). connect(1,2,w). connect(1,3,e). connect(1,4,n). connect(1,4,w). ... connect(4,4,w). max_steps(2).```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```The starting point is located at (5,21).

The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.", "format": "The fields of a quadratic NxN-labyrinth are provided by instances of predicate \"field\" as follows:\nfield(1,1). field(1,2). ... field(1,N). field(2,1). field(2,2). ... field(2,N). ... field(N,1). field(N,2). ... field(N,N).\n\nThe starting and the goal field are specified by exactly one instance of \"init_on\" and exactly one instance of \"goal_on\":\ninit_on(x_i,y_i). goal_on(x_g,y_g).\n\nIt always holds that 1 ≤ x_i,y_i,x_g,y_g ≤ N.\nThe connections of fields are given by instances of \"connect\" looking as follows: connect(x,y,d).\n\nAgain, we have 1 ≤ x,y ≤ N.

deals with guiding an avatar through a dynamically changing labyrinth to certain fields. The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```The fields of a quadratic NxN-labyrinth are provided by instances of predicate \"field\" as follows:\nfield(1,1). field(1,2). ... field(1,N). field(2,1). field(2,2). ... field(2,N). ... field(N,1). field(N,2). ... field(N,N).\n\nThe starting and the goal field are specified by exactly one instance of \"init_on\" and exactly one instance of \"goal_on\":\ninit_on(x_i,y_i). goal_on(x_g,y_g).\n\nIt always holds that 1 ≤ x_i,y_i,x_g,y_g ≤ N.\nThe connections of fields are given by instances of \"connect\" looking as follows: connect(x,y,d).\n\nAgain, we have 1 ≤ x,y ≤ N. Furthermore, direction d can be \"n\" for north, \"s\" for south, \"e\" for east, or \"w\" for west.\nFinally, the maximum number of pushes is determined by exactly one instance of \"max_steps\": max_steps(m).\n\nArgument m is a positive integer. An exemplary input for the above example looks as follows:\nfield(1,1). ... field(1,4). .... field(4,1). ... field(4,4). init_on(3,2). goal_on(1,4). connect(1,1,s). connect(1,1,w). connect(1,2,n). connect(1,2,e). connect(1,2,w). connect(1,3,e). connect(1,4,n). connect(1,4,w). ... connect(4,4,w). max_steps(2).```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```The following fields have connections to the west: (1, 13), (1, 14), (1, 18), (1, 3), (1, 7), (10, 10), (10, 14), (10, 15).

The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.", "format": "The fields of a quadratic NxN-labyrinth are provided by instances of predicate \"field\" as follows:\nfield(1,1). field(1,2). ... field(1,N). field(2,1). field(2,2). ... field(2,N). ... field(N,1). field(N,2). ... field(N,N).\n\nThe starting and the goal field are specified by exactly one instance of \"init_on\" and exactly one instance of \"goal_on\":\ninit_on(x_i,y_i). goal_on(x_g,y_g).\n\nIt always holds that 1 ≤ x_i,y_i,x_g,y_g ≤ N.\nThe connections of fields are given by instances of \"connect\" looking as follows: connect(x,y,d).\n\nAgain, we have 1 ≤ x,y ≤ N.

The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```The fields of a quadratic NxN-labyrinth are provided by instances of predicate \"field\" as follows:\nfield(1,1). field(1,2). ... field(1,N). field(2,1). field(2,2). ... field(2,N). ... field(N,1). field(N,2). ... field(N,N).\n\nThe starting and the goal field are specified by exactly one instance of \"init_on\" and exactly one instance of \"goal_on\":\ninit_on(x_i,y_i). goal_on(x_g,y_g).\n\nIt always holds that 1 ≤ x_i,y_i,x_g,y_g ≤ N.\nThe connections of fields are given by instances of \"connect\" looking as follows: connect(x,y,d).\n\nAgain, we have 1 ≤ x,y ≤ N. Furthermore, direction d can be \"n\" for north, \"s\" for south, \"e\" for east, or \"w\" for west.\nFinally, the maximum number of pushes is determined by exactly one instance of \"max_steps\": max_steps(m).\n\nArgument m is a positive integer. An exemplary input for the above example looks as follows:\nfield(1,1). ... field(1,4). .... field(4,1). ... field(4,4). init_on(3,2). goal_on(1,4). connect(1,1,s). connect(1,1,w). connect(1,2,n). connect(1,2,e). connect(1,2,w). connect(1,3,e). connect(1,4,n). connect(1,4,w). ... connect(4,4,w). max_steps(2).```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```The starting coordinates are (6,9).

The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.", "format": "The fields of a quadratic NxN-labyrinth are provided by instances of predicate \"field\" as follows:\nfield(1,1). field(1,2). ... field(1,N). field(2,1). field(2,2). ... field(2,N). ... field(N,1). field(N,2). ... field(N,N).\n\nThe starting and the goal field are specified by exactly one instance of \"init_on\" and exactly one instance of \"goal_on\":\ninit_on(x_i,y_i). goal_on(x_g,y_g).\n\nIt always holds that 1 ≤ x_i,y_i,x_g,y_g ≤ N.\nThe connections of fields are given by instances of \"connect\" looking as follows: connect(x,y,d).\n\nAgain, we have 1 ≤ x,y ≤ N.

{"id": "7025626065877801958", "problem_id": "18", "problem_name": "Labyrinth", "description": "Ravensburger's Labyrinth game deals with guiding an avatar through a dynamically changing labyrinth to certain fields. The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions.

The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.", "format": "The fields of a quadratic NxN-labyrinth are provided by instances of predicate \"field\" as follows:\nfield(1,1). field(1,2). ... field(1,N). field(2,1). field(2,2). ... field(2,N). ... field(N,1). field(N,2). ... field(N,N).\n\nThe starting and the goal field are specified by exactly one instance of \"init_on\" and exactly one instance of \"goal_on\":\ninit_on(x_i,y_i). goal_on(x_g,y_g).\n\nIt always holds that 1 ≤ x_i,y_i,x_g,y_g ≤ N.\nThe connections of fields are given by instances of \"connect\" looking as follows: connect(x,y,d).\n\nAgain, we have 1 ≤ x,y ≤ N.

problem description between triple backtips: \n ```Ravensburger's Labyrinth game deals with guiding an avatar through a dynamically changing labyrinth to certain fields. The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```The fields of a quadratic NxN-labyrinth are provided by instances of predicate \"field\" as follows:\nfield(1,1). field(1,2). ... field(1,N). field(2,1). field(2,2). ... field(2,N). ... field(N,1). field(N,2). ... field(N,N).\n\nThe starting and the goal field are specified by exactly one instance of \"init_on\" and exactly one instance of \"goal_on\":\ninit_on(x_i,y_i). goal_on(x_g,y_g).\n\nIt always holds that 1 ≤ x_i,y_i,x_g,y_g ≤ N.\nThe connections of fields are given by instances of \"connect\" looking as follows: connect(x,y,d).\n\nAgain, we have 1 ≤ x,y ≤ N. Furthermore, direction d can be \"n\" for north, \"s\" for south, \"e\" for east, or \"w\" for west.\nFinally, the maximum number of pushes is determined by exactly one instance of \"max_steps\": max_steps(m).\n\nArgument m is a positive integer. An exemplary input for the above example looks as follows:\nfield(1,1). ... field(1,4). .... field(4,1). ... field(4,4). init_on(3,2). goal_on(1,4). connect(1,1,s). connect(1,1,w). connect(1,2,n). connect(1,2,e). connect(1,2,w). connect(1,3,e). connect(1,4,n). connect(1,4,w). ... connect(4,4,w). max_steps(2).```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```The following fields have connections to the south: (1, 1), (1, 13), (1, 16), (1, 18), (1, 19), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 8).

The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.", "format": "The fields of a quadratic NxN-labyrinth are provided by instances of predicate \"field\" as follows:\nfield(1,1). field(1,2). ... field(1,N). field(2,1). field(2,2). ... field(2,N). ... field(N,1). field(N,2). ... field(N,N).\n\nThe starting and the goal field are specified by exactly one instance of \"init_on\" and exactly one instance of \"goal_on\":\ninit_on(x_i,y_i). goal_on(x_g,y_g).\n\nIt always holds that 1 ≤ x_i,y_i,x_g,y_g ≤ N.\nThe connections of fields are given by instances of \"connect\" looking as follows: connect(x,y,d).\n\nAgain, we have 1 ≤ x,y ≤ N. Furthermore, direction d can be \"n\" for north, \"s\" for south, \"e\" for east, or \"w\" for west.\nFinally, the maximum number of pushes is determined by exactly one instance of \"max_steps\": max_steps(m).\n\nArgument m is a positive integer. An exemplary input for the above example looks as follows:\nfield(1,1). ... field(1,4). .... field(4,1). ... field(4,4). init_on(3,2). goal_on(1,4). connect(1,1,s). connect(1,1,w). connect(1,2,n). connect(1,2,e). connect(1,2,w). connect(1,3,e). connect(1,4,n). connect(1,4,w). ... connect(4,4,w). max_steps(2).", "text": "The following fields have connections to the west: (1, 11), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 9), (10, 11), (10, 13), (10, 14).

game deals with guiding an avatar through a dynamically changing labyrinth to certain fields. The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```The fields of a quadratic NxN-labyrinth are provided by instances of predicate \"field\" as follows:\nfield(1,1). field(1,2). ... field(1,N). field(2,1). field(2,2). ... field(2,N). ... field(N,1). field(N,2). ... field(N,N).\n\nThe starting and the goal field are specified by exactly one instance of \"init_on\" and exactly one instance of \"goal_on\":\ninit_on(x_i,y_i). goal_on(x_g,y_g).\n\nIt always holds that 1 ≤ x_i,y_i,x_g,y_g ≤ N.\nThe connections of fields are given by instances of \"connect\" looking as follows: connect(x,y,d).\n\nAgain, we have 1 ≤ x,y ≤ N. Furthermore, direction d can be \"n\" for north, \"s\" for south, \"e\" for east, or \"w\" for west.\nFinally, the maximum number of pushes is determined by exactly one instance of \"max_steps\": max_steps(m).\n\nArgument m is a positive integer. An exemplary input for the above example looks as follows:\nfield(1,1). ... field(1,4). .... field(4,1). ... field(4,4). init_on(3,2). goal_on(1,4). connect(1,1,s). connect(1,1,w). connect(1,2,n). connect(1,2,e). connect(1,2,w). connect(1,3,e). connect(1,4,n). connect(1,4,w). ... connect(4,4,w). max_steps(2).```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```The following fields have connections to the west: (1, 11), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 9), (10, 11), (10, 13), (10, 14).

The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.", "format": "The fields of a quadratic NxN-labyrinth are provided by instances of predicate \"field\" as follows:\nfield(1,1). field(1,2). ... field(1,N). field(2,1). field(2,2). ... field(2,N). ... field(N,1). field(N,2). ... field(N,N).\n\nThe starting and the goal field are specified by exactly one instance of \"init_on\" and exactly one instance of \"goal_on\":\ninit_on(x_i,y_i). goal_on(x_g,y_g).\n\nIt always holds that 1 ≤ x_i,y_i,x_g,y_g ≤ N.\nThe connections of fields are given by instances of \"connect\" looking as follows: connect(x,y,d).\n\nAgain, we have 1 ≤ x,y ≤ N.

The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```The fields of a quadratic NxN-labyrinth are provided by instances of predicate \"field\" as follows:\nfield(1,1). field(1,2). ... field(1,N). field(2,1). field(2,2). ... field(2,N). ... field(N,1). field(N,2). ... field(N,N).\n\nThe starting and the goal field are specified by exactly one instance of \"init_on\" and exactly one instance of \"goal_on\":\ninit_on(x_i,y_i). goal_on(x_g,y_g).\n\nIt always holds that 1 ≤ x_i,y_i,x_g,y_g ≤ N.\nThe connections of fields are given by instances of \"connect\" looking as follows: connect(x,y,d).\n\nAgain, we have 1 ≤ x,y ≤ N. Furthermore, direction d can be \"n\" for north, \"s\" for south, \"e\" for east, or \"w\" for west.\nFinally, the maximum number of pushes is determined by exactly one instance of \"max_steps\": max_steps(m).\n\nArgument m is a positive integer.

The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.", "format": "The fields of a quadratic NxN-labyrinth are provided by instances of predicate \"field\" as follows:\nfield(1,1). field(1,2). ... field(1,N). field(2,1). field(2,2). ... field(2,N). ... field(N,1). field(N,2). ... field(N,N).\n\nThe starting and the goal field are specified by exactly one instance of \"init_on\" and exactly one instance of \"goal_on\":\ninit_on(x_i,y_i). goal_on(x_g,y_g).\n\nIt always holds that 1 ≤ x_i,y_i,x_g,y_g ≤ N.\nThe connections of fields are given by instances of \"connect\" looking as follows: connect(x,y,d).\n\nAgain, we have 1 ≤ x,y ≤ N.

The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.", "format": "The fields of a quadratic NxN-labyrinth are provided by instances of predicate \"field\" as follows:\nfield(1,1). field(1,2). ... field(1,N). field(2,1). field(2,2). ... field(2,N). ... field(N,1). field(N,2). ... field(N,N).\n\nThe starting and the goal field are specified by exactly one instance of \"init_on\" and exactly one instance of \"goal_on\":\ninit_on(x_i,y_i). goal_on(x_g,y_g).\n\nIt always holds that 1 ≤ x_i,y_i,x_g,y_g ≤ N.\nThe connections of fields are given by instances of \"connect\" looking as follows: connect(x,y,d).\n\nAgain, we have 1 ≤ x,y ≤ N.

problem description between triple backtips: \n ```Ravensburger's Labyrinth game deals with guiding an avatar through a dynamically changing labyrinth to certain fields. The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```The fields of a quadratic NxN-labyrinth are provided by instances of predicate \"field\" as follows:\nfield(1,1). field(1,2). ... field(1,N). field(2,1). field(2,2). ... field(2,N). ... field(N,1). field(N,2). ... field(N,N).\n\nThe starting and the goal field are specified by exactly one instance of \"init_on\" and exactly one instance of \"goal_on\":\ninit_on(x_i,y_i). goal_on(x_g,y_g).\n\nIt always holds that 1 ≤ x_i,y_i,x_g,y_g ≤ N.\nThe connections of fields are given by instances of \"connect\" looking as follows: connect(x,y,d).\n\nAgain, we have 1 ≤ x,y ≤ N. Furthermore, direction d can be \"n\" for north, \"s\" for south, \"e\" for east, or \"w\" for west.\nFinally, the maximum number of pushes is determined by exactly one instance of \"max_steps\": max_steps(m).\n\nArgument m is a positive integer. An exemplary input for the above example looks as follows:\nfield(1,1). ... field(1,4). .... field(4,1). ... field(4,4). init_on(3,2). goal_on(1,4). connect(1,1,s). connect(1,1,w). connect(1,2,n). connect(1,2,e). connect(1,2,w). connect(1,3,e). connect(1,4,n). connect(1,4,w). ... connect(4,4,w). max_steps(2).```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```The goal field is positioned at (2, 5).

The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.", "format": "The fields of a quadratic NxN-labyrinth are provided by instances of predicate \"field\" as follows:\nfield(1,1). field(1,2). ... field(1,N). field(2,1). field(2,2). ... field(2,N). ... field(N,1). field(N,2). ... field(N,N).\n\nThe starting and the goal field are specified by exactly one instance of \"init_on\" and exactly one instance of \"goal_on\":\ninit_on(x_i,y_i). goal_on(x_g,y_g).\n\nIt always holds that 1 ≤ x_i,y_i,x_g,y_g ≤ N.\nThe connections of fields are given by instances of \"connect\" looking as follows: connect(x,y,d).\n\nAgain, we have 1 ≤ x,y ≤ N. Furthermore, direction d can be \"n\" for north, \"s\" for south, \"e\" for east, or \"w\" for west.\nFinally, the maximum number of pushes is determined by exactly one instance of \"max_steps\": max_steps(m).\n\nArgument m is a positive integer.

The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```The fields of a quadratic NxN-labyrinth are provided by instances of predicate \"field\" as follows:\nfield(1,1). field(1,2). ... field(1,N). field(2,1). field(2,2). ... field(2,N). ... field(N,1). field(N,2). ... field(N,N).\n\nThe starting and the goal field are specified by exactly one instance of \"init_on\" and exactly one instance of \"goal_on\":\ninit_on(x_i,y_i). goal_on(x_g,y_g).\n\nIt always holds that 1 ≤ x_i,y_i,x_g,y_g ≤ N.\nThe connections of fields are given by instances of \"connect\" looking as follows: connect(x,y,d).\n\nAgain, we have 1 ≤ x,y ≤ N. Furthermore, direction d can be \"n\" for north, \"s\" for south, \"e\" for east, or \"w\" for west.\nFinally, the maximum number of pushes is determined by exactly one instance of \"max_steps\": max_steps(m).\n\nArgument m is a positive integer. An exemplary input for the above example looks as follows:\nfield(1,1). ... field(1,4). .... field(4,1). ... field(4,4). init_on(3,2). goal_on(1,4). connect(1,1,s). connect(1,1,w). connect(1,2,n). connect(1,2,e). connect(1,2,w). connect(1,3,e). connect(1,4,n). connect(1,4,w). ... connect(4,4,w). max_steps(2).```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```The goal field is placed at (13, 13).

The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.", "format": "The fields of a quadratic NxN-labyrinth are provided by instances of predicate \"field\" as follows:\nfield(1,1). field(1,2). ... field(1,N). field(2,1). field(2,2). ... field(2,N). ... field(N,1). field(N,2). ... field(N,N).\n\nThe starting and the goal field are specified by exactly one instance of \"init_on\" and exactly one instance of \"goal_on\":\ninit_on(x_i,y_i). goal_on(x_g,y_g).\n\nIt always holds that 1 ≤ x_i,y_i,x_g,y_g ≤ N.\nThe connections of fields are given by instances of \"connect\" looking as follows: connect(x,y,d).\n\nAgain, we have 1 ≤ x,y ≤ N.

(Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```The fields of a quadratic NxN-labyrinth are provided by instances of predicate \"field\" as follows:\nfield(1,1). field(1,2). ... field(1,N). field(2,1). field(2,2). ... field(2,N). ... field(N,1). field(N,2). ... field(N,N).\n\nThe starting and the goal field are specified by exactly one instance of \"init_on\" and exactly one instance of \"goal_on\":\ninit_on(x_i,y_i). goal_on(x_g,y_g).\n\nIt always holds that 1 ≤ x_i,y_i,x_g,y_g ≤ N.\nThe connections of fields are given by instances of \"connect\" looking as follows: connect(x,y,d).\n\nAgain, we have 1 ≤ x,y ≤ N.

The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```The fields of a quadratic NxN-labyrinth are provided by instances of predicate \"field\" as follows:\nfield(1,1). field(1,2). ... field(1,N). field(2,1). field(2,2). ... field(2,N). ... field(N,1). field(N,2). ... field(N,N).\n\nThe starting and the goal field are specified by exactly one instance of \"init_on\" and exactly one instance of \"goal_on\":\ninit_on(x_i,y_i). goal_on(x_g,y_g).\n\nIt always holds that 1 ≤ x_i,y_i,x_g,y_g ≤ N.\nThe connections of fields are given by instances of \"connect\" looking as follows: connect(x,y,d).\n\nAgain, we have 1 ≤ x,y ≤ N. Furthermore, direction d can be \"n\" for north, \"s\" for south, \"e\" for east, or \"w\" for west.\nFinally, the maximum number of pushes is determined by exactly one instance of \"max_steps\": max_steps(m).\n\nArgument m is a positive integer. An exemplary input for the above example looks as follows:\nfield(1,1). ... field(1,4). .... field(4,1). ... field(4,4). init_on(3,2). goal_on(1,4). connect(1,1,s). connect(1,1,w). connect(1,2,n). connect(1,2,e). connect(1,2,w). connect(1,3,e). connect(1,4,n). connect(1,4,w). ... connect(4,4,w). max_steps(2).```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```The fields of a quadratic 10x10 labyrinth are provided by instances of predicate \"field\" with values from 1 to 10 in both x and y coordinates.

An exemplary input for the above example looks as follows:\nfield(1,1). ... field(1,4). .... field(4,1). ... field(4,4). init_on(3,2). goal_on(1,4). connect(1,1,s). connect(1,1,w). connect(1,2,n). connect(1,2,e). connect(1,2,w). connect(1,3,e). connect(1,4,n). connect(1,4,w). ... connect(4,4,w). max_steps(2).```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```The following fields have connections to the north: (1, 10), (1, 15), (1, 17), (1, 19), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6).

While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track).

While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track).

Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required.

While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track).

While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track).

Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes.

The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track).

Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes.

Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes.

While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track).

While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track).

While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track).

While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption.

They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track). As the domain creator said, this was the most difficult one of the two formulations for planning systems. We retained the Hard version of the problem for the ASP Competition 2013. Instances have only one truck.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```In the setting of the ASP competition, input predicates encode the weighted graph at hand, the initial positions of packages and of the truck, the initial fuel available and the final requested destination for packages. In detail input assertions are to be interpreted as follows:\n- fuelcost(c,a,b): the locations a and b are connected and the cost for travelling from a to b is c (for c a positive integer) \n- at(o,l): the object o (either a package or a truck) is initially at location\n- l fuel(t,l): the initial fuel available for truck t is l (for l a positive integer) \n- goal(p,l): at the final step, the package p must stay at location\n- l step(s): s is an allowed step, for s a positive integer value\nthe predicate step is intended in order to encode the maximum number of allowed steps.

While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track).

While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track).

While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track).

While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track). As the domain creator said, this was the most difficult one of the two formulations for planning systems. We retained the Hard version of the problem for the ASP Competition 2013.

While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track).

While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track).

While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track).

While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track).

While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track).

'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box). The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations. To this end, the sokoban can walk on floor locations (unless occupied by some box), and push single boxes onto unoccupied floor locations.\nIn the decision version of this problem, the question to answer is whether a solution involving at most N actions exists, for N given as input. If so, a witness containing the sequence of actions should be produced; otherwise no solution should be output.", "format": "In our setting, an instance contains the warehouse layout, representing the floor locations, and in particular their horizontal and vertical relationships; storage locations, where the boxes should eventually go to; and, initial positions of stones and the sokoban.

To this end, the sokoban can walk on floor locations (unless occupied by some box), and push single boxes onto unoccupied floor locations.\nIn the decision version of this problem, the question to answer is whether a solution involving at most N actions exists, for N given as input. If so, a witness containing the sequence of actions should be produced; otherwise no solution should be output.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```In our setting, an instance contains the warehouse layout, representing the floor locations, and in particular their horizontal and vertical relationships; storage locations, where the boxes should eventually go to; and, initial positions of stones and the sokoban. This information is encoded as facts using predicates movedir/3, goal/1, stone/1, isgoal/2, player/1, at/2, clear/2 as follows:\n\nmovedir(x,y,dir): y is a location reachable by location x by moving towards direction dir, where dir can be one of 'dir_up','dir_down','dir_left','dir_right'.\n\ngoal(s): the stone s must be put in a goal location stone(s): s is a stone isgoal(l): l is a goal location isnongoal(l): l is not a goal location. This information can be obtained by complehementing information given by isgoal, but it has been retained for compatibility with the IPC 2011 domain description. player(p): p is the sokoban. at(o,p): the object o (either the sokoban or a stone) is initially at position p. clear(p): the floor location p is clear of objects.\n\nEach instance has exactly one fact for player/1. There can be in principle non-goal stones (i.e. there can be s such that stone(s) holds, but not goal(s)).\n\nAn instance also contains a sequence of time-steps for warehouse configurations, between which the actions occur:\n\nstep(s): s is an allowed step. It can be assumed steps are consecutive integers ranging from 1 towards a limit value N. Steps are associated to actions. It's up to problem modeller's how to treat properly the presence of N+1 intermediate states.```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```The following floor locations are clear of objects: pos_01_06, pos_01_07, pos_01_08, pos_01_09, pos_01_10, pos_01_11, pos_02_02, pos_02_03.

This year the problem specifications were adapted in order to adhere to the specifications of the homologous problem used at IPC 2011 and 2008, in order to achieve a clearer comparative picture between planners and ASP solvers.\nSokoban is a game puzzle developed by the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. in 1982. 'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box). The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations. To this end, the sokoban can walk on floor locations (unless occupied by some box), and push single boxes onto unoccupied floor locations.\nIn the decision version of this problem, the question to answer is whether a solution involving at most N actions exists, for N given as input. If so, a witness containing the sequence of actions should be produced; otherwise no solution should be output.", "format": "In our setting, an instance contains the warehouse layout, representing the floor locations, and in particular their horizontal and vertical relationships; storage locations, where the boxes should eventually go to; and, initial positions of stones and the sokoban. This information is encoded as facts using predicates movedir/3, goal/1, stone/1, isgoal/2, player/1, at/2, clear/2 as follows:\n\nmovedir(x,y,dir): y is a location reachable by location x by moving towards direction dir, where dir can be one of 'dir_up','dir_down','dir_left','dir_right'.\n\ngoal(s): the stone s must be put in a goal location stone(s): s is a stone isgoal(l): l is a goal location isnongoal(l): l is not a goal location. This information can be obtained by complehementing information given by isgoal, but it has been retained for compatibility with the IPC 2011 domain description. player(p): p is the sokoban. at(o,p): the object o (either the sokoban or a stone) is initially at position p. clear(p): the floor location p is clear of objects.\n\nEach instance has exactly one fact for player/1. There can be in principle non-goal stones (i.e. there can be s such that stone(s) holds, but not goal(s)).\n\nAn instance also contains a sequence of time-steps for warehouse configurations, between which the actions occur:\n\nstep(s): s is an allowed step. It can be assumed steps are consecutive integers ranging from 1 towards a limit value N. Steps are associated to actions. It's up to problem modeller's how to treat properly the presence of N+1 intermediate states.", "text": "Stone stone_02 has to be positioned in a goal location.

This year the problem specifications were adapted in order to adhere to the specifications of the homologous problem used at IPC 2011 and 2008, in order to achieve a clearer comparative picture between planners and ASP solvers.\nSokoban is a game puzzle developed by the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. in 1982. 'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box). The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations. To this end, the sokoban can walk on floor locations (unless occupied by some box), and push single boxes onto unoccupied floor locations.\nIn the decision version of this problem, the question to answer is whether a solution involving at most N actions exists, for N given as input. If so, a witness containing the sequence of actions should be produced; otherwise no solution should be output.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```In our setting, an instance contains the warehouse layout, representing the floor locations, and in particular their horizontal and vertical relationships; storage locations, where the boxes should eventually go to; and, initial positions of stones and the sokoban. This information is encoded as facts using predicates movedir/3, goal/1, stone/1, isgoal/2, player/1, at/2, clear/2 as follows:\n\nmovedir(x,y,dir): y is a location reachable by location x by moving towards direction dir, where dir can be one of 'dir_up','dir_down','dir_left','dir_right'.\n\ngoal(s): the stone s must be put in a goal location stone(s): s is a stone isgoal(l): l is a goal location isnongoal(l): l is not a goal location. This information can be obtained by complehementing information given by isgoal, but it has been retained for compatibility with the IPC 2011 domain description. player(p): p is the sokoban. at(o,p): the object o (either the sokoban or a stone) is initially at position p. clear(p): the floor location p is clear of objects.\n\nEach instance has exactly one fact for player/1. There can be in principle non-goal stones (i.e. there can be s such that stone(s) holds, but not goal(s)).\n\nAn instance also contains a sequence of time-steps for warehouse configurations, between which the actions occur:\n\nstep(s): s is an allowed step. It can be assumed steps are consecutive integers ranging from 1 towards a limit value N. Steps are associated to actions. It's up to problem modeller's how to treat properly the presence of N+1 intermediate states.```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```Stone stone_02 has to be positioned in a goal location.

{"id": "1043068408654049224", "problem_id": "45", "problem_name": "Sokoban", "description": "Sokoban is a classic problem which appeared so far in all the ASP Competitions. This year the problem specifications were adapted in order to adhere to the specifications of the homologous problem used at IPC 2011 and 2008, in order to achieve a clearer comparative picture between planners and ASP solvers.\nSokoban is a game puzzle developed by the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. in 1982. 'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box).

This year the problem specifications were adapted in order to adhere to the specifications of the homologous problem used at IPC 2011 and 2008, in order to achieve a clearer comparative picture between planners and ASP solvers.\nSokoban is a game puzzle developed by the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. in 1982. 'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box). The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations. To this end, the sokoban can walk on floor locations (unless occupied by some box), and push single boxes onto unoccupied floor locations.\nIn the decision version of this problem, the question to answer is whether a solution involving at most N actions exists, for N given as input. If so, a witness containing the sequence of actions should be produced; otherwise no solution should be output.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```In our setting, an instance contains the warehouse layout, representing the floor locations, and in particular their horizontal and vertical relationships; storage locations, where the boxes should eventually go to; and, initial positions of stones and the sokoban.

This year the problem specifications were adapted in order to adhere to the specifications of the homologous problem used at IPC 2011 and 2008, in order to achieve a clearer comparative picture between planners and ASP solvers.\nSokoban is a game puzzle developed by the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. in 1982. 'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box). The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations. To this end, the sokoban can walk on floor locations (unless occupied by some box), and push single boxes onto unoccupied floor locations.\nIn the decision version of this problem, the question to answer is whether a solution involving at most N actions exists, for N given as input.

This year the problem specifications were adapted in order to adhere to the specifications of the homologous problem used at IPC 2011 and 2008, in order to achieve a clearer comparative picture between planners and ASP solvers.\nSokoban is a game puzzle developed by the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. in 1982. 'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box). The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations. To this end, the sokoban can walk on floor locations (unless occupied by some box), and push single boxes onto unoccupied floor locations.\nIn the decision version of this problem, the question to answer is whether a solution involving at most N actions exists, for N given as input. If so, a witness containing the sequence of actions should be produced; otherwise no solution should be output.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```In our setting, an instance contains the warehouse layout, representing the floor locations, and in particular their horizontal and vertical relationships; storage locations, where the boxes should eventually go to; and, initial positions of stones and the sokoban.

There can be in principle non-goal stones (i.e. there can be s such that stone(s) holds, but not goal(s)).\n\nAn instance also contains a sequence of time-steps for warehouse configurations, between which the actions occur:\n\nstep(s): s is an allowed step.

This year the problem specifications were adapted in order to adhere to the specifications of the homologous problem used at IPC 2011 and 2008, in order to achieve a clearer comparative picture between planners and ASP solvers.\nSokoban is a game puzzle developed by the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. in 1982. 'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box). The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations. To this end, the sokoban can walk on floor locations (unless occupied by some box), and push single boxes onto unoccupied floor locations.\nIn the decision version of this problem, the question to answer is whether a solution involving at most N actions exists, for N given as input. If so, a witness containing the sequence of actions should be produced; otherwise no solution should be output.", "format": "In our setting, an instance contains the warehouse layout, representing the floor locations, and in particular their horizontal and vertical relationships; storage locations, where the boxes should eventually go to; and, initial positions of stones and the sokoban. This information is encoded as facts using predicates movedir/3, goal/1, stone/1, isgoal/2, player/1, at/2, clear/2 as follows:\n\nmovedir(x,y,dir): y is a location reachable by location x by moving towards direction dir, where dir can be one of 'dir_up','dir_down','dir_left','dir_right'.\n\ngoal(s): the stone s must be put in a goal location stone(s): s is a stone isgoal(l): l is a goal location isnongoal(l): l is not a goal location. This information can be obtained by complehementing information given by isgoal, but it has been retained for compatibility with the IPC 2011 domain description. player(p): p is the sokoban. at(o,p): the object o (either the sokoban or a stone) is initially at position p. clear(p): the floor location p is clear of objects.\n\nEach instance has exactly one fact for player/1. There can be in principle non-goal stones (i.e. there can be s such that stone(s) holds, but not goal(s)).\n\nAn instance also contains a sequence of time-steps for warehouse configurations, between which the actions occur:\n\nstep(s): s is an allowed step. It can be assumed steps are consecutive integers ranging from 1 towards a limit value N. Steps are associated to actions. It's up to problem modeller's how to treat properly the presence of N+1 intermediate states.", "text": "Player player_01 is the sokoban.

This year the problem specifications were adapted in order to adhere to the specifications of the homologous problem used at IPC 2011 and 2008, in order to achieve a clearer comparative picture between planners and ASP solvers.\nSokoban is a game puzzle developed by the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. in 1982. 'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box). The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations. To this end, the sokoban can walk on floor locations (unless occupied by some box), and push single boxes onto unoccupied floor locations.\nIn the decision version of this problem, the question to answer is whether a solution involving at most N actions exists, for N given as input. If so, a witness containing the sequence of actions should be produced; otherwise no solution should be output.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```In our setting, an instance contains the warehouse layout, representing the floor locations, and in particular their horizontal and vertical relationships; storage locations, where the boxes should eventually go to; and, initial positions of stones and the sokoban. This information is encoded as facts using predicates movedir/3, goal/1, stone/1, isgoal/2, player/1, at/2, clear/2 as follows:\n\nmovedir(x,y,dir): y is a location reachable by location x by moving towards direction dir, where dir can be one of 'dir_up','dir_down','dir_left','dir_right'.\n\ngoal(s): the stone s must be put in a goal location stone(s): s is a stone isgoal(l): l is a goal location isnongoal(l): l is not a goal location. This information can be obtained by complehementing information given by isgoal, but it has been retained for compatibility with the IPC 2011 domain description. player(p): p is the sokoban. at(o,p): the object o (either the sokoban or a stone) is initially at position p. clear(p): the floor location p is clear of objects.\n\nEach instance has exactly one fact for player/1. There can be in principle non-goal stones (i.e. there can be s such that stone(s) holds, but not goal(s)).\n\nAn instance also contains a sequence of time-steps for warehouse configurations, between which the actions occur:\n\nstep(s): s is an allowed step. It can be assumed steps are consecutive integers ranging from 1 towards a limit value N. Steps are associated to actions. It's up to problem modeller's how to treat properly the presence of N+1 intermediate states.```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```Player player_01 is the sokoban.

{"id": "8123721645406042428", "problem_id": "45", "problem_name": "Sokoban", "description": "Sokoban is a classic problem which appeared so far in all the ASP Competitions. This year the problem specifications were adapted in order to adhere to the specifications of the homologous problem used at IPC 2011 and 2008, in order to achieve a clearer comparative picture between planners and ASP solvers.\nSokoban is a game puzzle developed by the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. in 1982. 'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box).

This year the problem specifications were adapted in order to adhere to the specifications of the homologous problem used at IPC 2011 and 2008, in order to achieve a clearer comparative picture between planners and ASP solvers.\nSokoban is a game puzzle developed by the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. in 1982. 'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box). The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations. To this end, the sokoban can walk on floor locations (unless occupied by some box), and push single boxes onto unoccupied floor locations.\nIn the decision version of this problem, the question to answer is whether a solution involving at most N actions exists, for N given as input. If so, a witness containing the sequence of actions should be produced; otherwise no solution should be output.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```In our setting, an instance contains the warehouse layout, representing the floor locations, and in particular their horizontal and vertical relationships; storage locations, where the boxes should eventually go to; and, initial positions of stones and the sokoban.

{"id": "314259599296722396", "problem_id": "45", "problem_name": "Sokoban", "description": "Sokoban is a classic problem which appeared so far in all the ASP Competitions. This year the problem specifications were adapted in order to adhere to the specifications of the homologous problem used at IPC 2011 and 2008, in order to achieve a clearer comparative picture between planners and ASP solvers.\nSokoban is a game puzzle developed by the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. in 1982. 'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box). The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations.

This year the problem specifications were adapted in order to adhere to the specifications of the homologous problem used at IPC 2011 and 2008, in order to achieve a clearer comparative picture between planners and ASP solvers.\nSokoban is a game puzzle developed by the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. in 1982. 'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box). The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations. To this end, the sokoban can walk on floor locations (unless occupied by some box), and push single boxes onto unoccupied floor locations.\nIn the decision version of this problem, the question to answer is whether a solution involving at most N actions exists, for N given as input. If so, a witness containing the sequence of actions should be produced; otherwise no solution should be output.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```In our setting, an instance contains the warehouse layout, representing the floor locations, and in particular their horizontal and vertical relationships; storage locations, where the boxes should eventually go to; and, initial positions of stones and the sokoban.

This year the problem specifications were adapted in order to adhere to the specifications of the homologous problem used at IPC 2011 and 2008, in order to achieve a clearer comparative picture between planners and ASP solvers.\nSokoban is a game puzzle developed by the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. in 1982. 'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box). The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations. To this end, the sokoban can walk on floor locations (unless occupied by some box), and push single boxes onto unoccupied floor locations.\nIn the decision version of this problem, the question to answer is whether a solution involving at most N actions exists, for N given as input. If so, a witness containing the sequence of actions should be produced; otherwise no solution should be output.", "format": "In our setting, an instance contains the warehouse layout, representing the floor locations, and in particular their horizontal and vertical relationships; storage locations, where the boxes should eventually go to; and, initial positions of stones and the sokoban. This information is encoded as facts using predicates movedir/3, goal/1, stone/1, isgoal/2, player/1, at/2, clear/2 as follows:\n\nmovedir(x,y,dir): y is a location reachable by location x by moving towards direction dir, where dir can be one of 'dir_up','dir_down','dir_left','dir_right'.\n\ngoal(s): the stone s must be put in a goal location stone(s): s is a stone isgoal(l): l is a goal location isnongoal(l): l is not a goal location. This information can be obtained by complehementing information given by isgoal, but it has been retained for compatibility with the IPC 2011 domain description. player(p): p is the sokoban. at(o,p): the object o (either the sokoban or a stone) is initially at position p. clear(p): the floor location p is clear of objects.\n\nEach instance has exactly one fact for player/1. There can be in principle non-goal stones (i.e. there can be s such that stone(s) holds, but not goal(s)).\n\nAn instance also contains a sequence of time-steps for warehouse configurations, between which the actions occur:\n\nstep(s): s is an allowed step. It can be assumed steps are consecutive integers ranging from 1 towards a limit value N. Steps are associated to actions.

This year the problem specifications were adapted in order to adhere to the specifications of the homologous problem used at IPC 2011 and 2008, in order to achieve a clearer comparative picture between planners and ASP solvers.\nSokoban is a game puzzle developed by the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. in 1982. 'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box). The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations. To this end, the sokoban can walk on floor locations (unless occupied by some box), and push single boxes onto unoccupied floor locations.\nIn the decision version of this problem, the question to answer is whether a solution involving at most N actions exists, for N given as input. If so, a witness containing the sequence of actions should be produced; otherwise no solution should be output.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```In our setting, an instance contains the warehouse layout, representing the floor locations, and in particular their horizontal and vertical relationships; storage locations, where the boxes should eventually go to; and, initial positions of stones and the sokoban. This information is encoded as facts using predicates movedir/3, goal/1, stone/1, isgoal/2, player/1, at/2, clear/2 as follows:\n\nmovedir(x,y,dir): y is a location reachable by location x by moving towards direction dir, where dir can be one of 'dir_up','dir_down','dir_left','dir_right'.\n\ngoal(s): the stone s must be put in a goal location stone(s): s is a stone isgoal(l): l is a goal location isnongoal(l): l is not a goal location. This information can be obtained by complehementing information given by isgoal, but it has been retained for compatibility with the IPC 2011 domain description. player(p): p is the sokoban. at(o,p): the object o (either the sokoban or a stone) is initially at position p. clear(p): the floor location p is clear of objects.\n\nEach instance has exactly one fact for player/1. There can be in principle non-goal stones (i.e. there can be s such that stone(s) holds, but not goal(s)).\n\nAn instance also contains a sequence of time-steps for warehouse configurations, between which the actions occur:\n\nstep(s): s is an allowed step. It can be assumed steps are consecutive integers ranging from 1 towards a limit value N. Steps are associated to actions. It's up to problem modeller's how to treat properly the presence of N+1 intermediate states.```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```The object stone_02 is initially at position pos_7_4.

This information is encoded as facts using predicates movedir/3, goal/1, stone/1, isgoal/2, player/1, at/2, clear/2 as follows:\n\nmovedir(x,y,dir): y is a location reachable by location x by moving towards direction dir, where dir can be one of 'dir_up','dir_down','dir_left','dir_right'.\n\ngoal(s): the stone s must be put in a goal location stone(s): s is a stone isgoal(l): l is a goal location isnongoal(l): l is not a goal location. This information can be obtained by complehementing information given by isgoal, but it has been retained for compatibility with the IPC 2011 domain description. player(p): p is the sokoban. at(o,p): the object o (either the sokoban or a stone) is initially at position p. clear(p): the floor location p is clear of objects.\n\nEach instance has exactly one fact for player/1. There can be in principle non-goal stones (i.e. there can be s such that stone(s) holds, but not goal(s)).\n\nAn instance also contains a sequence of time-steps for warehouse configurations, between which the actions occur:\n\nstep(s): s is an allowed step. It can be assumed steps are consecutive integers ranging from 1 towards a limit value N. Steps are associated to actions. It's up to problem modeller's how to treat properly the presence of N+1 intermediate states.```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```At position pos_5_4 is stone_03 initially.

{"id": "1758448585626471766", "problem_id": "45", "problem_name": "Sokoban", "description": "Sokoban is a classic problem which appeared so far in all the ASP Competitions. This year the problem specifications were adapted in order to adhere to the specifications of the homologous problem used at IPC 2011 and 2008, in order to achieve a clearer comparative picture between planners and ASP solvers.\nSokoban is a game puzzle developed by the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. in 1982. 'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box).

This year the problem specifications were adapted in order to adhere to the specifications of the homologous problem used at IPC 2011 and 2008, in order to achieve a clearer comparative picture between planners and ASP solvers.\nSokoban is a game puzzle developed by the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. in 1982. 'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box). The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations. To this end, the sokoban can walk on floor locations (unless occupied by some box), and push single boxes onto unoccupied floor locations.\nIn the decision version of this problem, the question to answer is whether a solution involving at most N actions exists, for N given as input. If so, a witness containing the sequence of actions should be produced; otherwise no solution should be output.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```In our setting, an instance contains the warehouse layout, representing the floor locations, and in particular their horizontal and vertical relationships; storage locations, where the boxes should eventually go to; and, initial positions of stones and the sokoban.
