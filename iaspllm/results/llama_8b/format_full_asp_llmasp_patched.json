        "description": "Ravensburger's Labyrinth game deals with guiding an avatar through a dynamically changing labyrinth to certain fields. The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.",

The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.",

        "description": "Ravensburger's Labyrinth game deals with guiding an avatar through a dynamically changing labyrinth to certain fields. The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.",

        "prompt": "Given the following problem description between triple backtips: \n ```Ravensburger's Labyrinth game deals with guiding an avatar through a dynamically changing labyrinth to certain fields. The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```The fields of a quadratic NxN-labyrinth are provided by instances of predicate \"field\" as follows:\nfield,1,1. field,1,2. ... field,1,N. field,2,1. field,2,2. ... field,2,N. ... field,N,1. field,N,2. ... field,N,N.\n\nThe starting and the goal field are specified by exactly one instance of \"init_on\" and exactly one instance of \"goal_on\":\ninit_on,x_i,y_i. goal_on,x_g,y_g.\n\nIt always holds that 1 ≤ x_i,y_i,x_g,y_g ≤ N.\nThe connections of fields are given by instances of \"connect\" looking as follows: connect,x,y,d.\n\nAgain, we have 1 ≤ x,y ≤ N. Furthermore, direction d can be \"n\" for north, \"s\" for south, \"e\" for east, or \"w\" for west.\nFinally, the maximum number of pushes is determined by exactly one instance of \"max_steps\": max_steps,m.\n\nArgument m is a positive integer. An exemplary input for the above example looks as follows:\nfield,1,1. ... field,1,4. .... field,4,1. ... field,4,4. init_on,3,2. goal_on,1,4. connect,1,1,s. connect,1,1,w. connect,1,2,n. connect,1,2,e. connect,1,2,w. connect,1,3,e. connect,1,4,n. connect,1,4,w. ... connect,4,4,w. max_steps,2.```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```The following fields have connections to the east: (1, 1), (1, 10), (1, 13), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 8), (1, 9), (10, 2). The coordinates for the starting position are (5,4). The goal field is positioned at (2, 3).

The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.",

        "description": "Ravensburger's Labyrinth game deals with guiding an avatar through a dynamically changing labyrinth to certain fields. The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.",

        "prompt": "Given the following problem description between triple backtips: \n ```Ravensburger's Labyrinth game deals with guiding an avatar through a dynamically changing labyrinth to certain fields. The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```The fields of a quadratic NxN-labyrinth are provided by instances of predicate \"field\" as follows:\nfield,1,1. field,1,2. ... field,1,N. field,2,1. field,2,2. ... field,2,N. ... field,N,1. field,N,2. ... field,N,N.\n\nThe starting and the goal field are specified by exactly one instance of \"init_on\" and exactly one instance of \"goal_on\":\ninit_on,x_i,y_i. goal_on,x_g,y_g.\n\nIt always holds that 1 ≤ x_i,y_i,x_g,y_g ≤ N.\nThe connections of fields are given by instances of \"connect\" looking as follows: connect,x,y,d.\n\nAgain, we have 1 ≤ x,y ≤ N. Furthermore, direction d can be \"n\" for north, \"s\" for south, \"e\" for east, or \"w\" for west.\nFinally, the maximum number of pushes is determined by exactly one instance of \"max_steps\": max_steps,m.\n\nArgument m is a positive integer. An exemplary input for the above example looks as follows:\nfield,1,1. ... field,1,4. .... field,4,1. ... field,4,4. init_on,3,2. goal_on,1,4. connect,1,1,s. connect,1,1,w. connect,1,2,n. connect,1,2,e. connect,1,2,w. connect,1,3,e. connect,1,4,n. connect,1,4,w. ... connect,4,4,w. max_steps,2.```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```The coordinates for the starting position are (7,7).

        "description": "Ravensburger's Labyrinth game deals with guiding an avatar through a dynamically changing labyrinth to certain fields. The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.",

        "prompt": "Given the following problem description between triple backtips: \n ```Ravensburger's Labyrinth game deals with guiding an avatar through a dynamically changing labyrinth to certain fields. The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```The fields of a quadratic NxN-labyrinth are provided by instances of predicate \"field\" as follows:\nfield,1,1. field,1,2. ... field,1,N. field,2,1. field,2,2. ... field,2,N. ... field,N,1. field,N,2. ... field,N,N.\n\nThe starting and the goal field are specified by exactly one instance of \"init_on\" and exactly one instance of \"goal_on\":\ninit_on,x_i,y_i. goal_on,x_g,y_g.\n\nIt always holds that 1 ≤ x_i,y_i,x_g,y_g ≤ N.\nThe connections of fields are given by instances of \"connect\" looking as follows: connect,x,y,d.\n\nAgain, we have 1 ≤ x,y ≤ N. Furthermore, direction d can be \"n\" for north, \"s\" for south, \"e\" for east, or \"w\" for west.\nFinally, the maximum number of pushes is determined by exactly one instance of \"max_steps\": max_steps,m.\n\nArgument m is a positive integer. An exemplary input for the above example looks as follows:\nfield,1,1. ... field,1,4. .... field,4,1. ... field,4,4. init_on,3,2. goal_on,1,4. connect,1,1,s. connect,1,1,w. connect,1,2,n. connect,1,2,e. connect,1,2,w. connect,1,3,e. connect,1,4,n. connect,1,4,w. ... connect,4,4,w. max_steps,2.```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```The fields of a quadratic 19x19 labyrinth are provided by instances of predicate \"field\" with values from 1 to 19 in both x and y coordinates. The coordinates for the starting position are (17,4). The following fields have connections to the east: (1, 10), (1, 11), (1, 14), (1, 16), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 7).

The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.",

        "description": "Ravensburger's Labyrinth game deals with guiding an avatar through a dynamically changing labyrinth to certain fields. The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.",

        "prompt": "Given the following problem description between triple backtips: \n ```Ravensburger's Labyrinth game deals with guiding an avatar through a dynamically changing labyrinth to certain fields. The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```The fields of a quadratic NxN-labyrinth are provided by instances of predicate \"field\" as follows:\nfield,1,1. field,1,2. ... field,1,N. field,2,1. field,2,2. ... field,2,N. ... field,N,1. field,N,2. ... field,N,N.\n\nThe starting and the goal field are specified by exactly one instance of \"init_on\" and exactly one instance of \"goal_on\":\ninit_on,x_i,y_i. goal_on,x_g,y_g.\n\nIt always holds that 1 ≤ x_i,y_i,x_g,y_g ≤ N.\nThe connections of fields are given by instances of \"connect\" looking as follows: connect,x,y,d.\n\nAgain, we have 1 ≤ x,y ≤ N. Furthermore, direction d can be \"n\" for north, \"s\" for south, \"e\" for east, or \"w\" for west.\nFinally, the maximum number of pushes is determined by exactly one instance of \"max_steps\": max_steps,m.\n\nArgument m is a positive integer. An exemplary input for the above example looks as follows:\nfield,1,1. ... field,1,4. .... field,4,1. ... field,4,4. init_on,3,2. goal_on,1,4. connect,1,1,s. connect,1,1,w. connect,1,2,n. connect,1,2,e. connect,1,2,w. connect,1,3,e. connect,1,4,n. connect,1,4,w. ... connect,4,4,w. max_steps,2.```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```The starting field is at (14,6).

        "description": "Ravensburger's Labyrinth game deals with guiding an avatar through a dynamically changing labyrinth to certain fields. The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.",

        "prompt": "Given the following problem description between triple backtips: \n ```Ravensburger's Labyrinth game deals with guiding an avatar through a dynamically changing labyrinth to certain fields. The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```The fields of a quadratic NxN-labyrinth are provided by instances of predicate \"field\" as follows:\nfield,1,1. field,1,2. ... field,1,N. field,2,1. field,2,2. ... field,2,N. ... field,N,1. field,N,2. ... field,N,N.\n\nThe starting and the goal field are specified by exactly one instance of \"init_on\" and exactly one instance of \"goal_on\":\ninit_on,x_i,y_i. goal_on,x_g,y_g.\n\nIt always holds that 1 ≤ x_i,y_i,x_g,y_g ≤ N.\nThe connections of fields are given by instances of \"connect\" looking as follows: connect,x,y,d.\n\nAgain, we have 1 ≤ x,y ≤ N. Furthermore, direction d can be \"n\" for north, \"s\" for south, \"e\" for east, or \"w\" for west.\nFinally, the maximum number of pushes is determined by exactly one instance of \"max_steps\": max_steps,m.\n\nArgument m is a positive integer. An exemplary input for the above example looks as follows:\nfield,1,1. ... field,1,4. .... field,4,1. ... field,4,4. init_on,3,2. goal_on,1,4. connect,1,1,s. connect,1,1,w. connect,1,2,n. connect,1,2,e. connect,1,2,w. connect,1,3,e. connect,1,4,n. connect,1,4,w. ... connect,4,4,w. max_steps,2.```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```The following fields have connections to the west: (1, 1), (1, 11), (1, 12), (1, 15), (1, 19), (1, 2), (1, 20), (1, 22).

The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.",

        "description": "Ravensburger's Labyrinth game deals with guiding an avatar through a dynamically changing labyrinth to certain fields. The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.",

        "prompt": "Given the following problem description between triple backtips: \n ```Ravensburger's Labyrinth game deals with guiding an avatar through a dynamically changing labyrinth to certain fields. The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```The fields of a quadratic NxN-labyrinth are provided by instances of predicate \"field\" as follows:\nfield,1,1. field,1,2. ... field,1,N. field,2,1. field,2,2. ... field,2,N. ... field,N,1. field,N,2. ... field,N,N.\n\nThe starting and the goal field are specified by exactly one instance of \"init_on\" and exactly one instance of \"goal_on\":\ninit_on,x_i,y_i. goal_on,x_g,y_g.\n\nIt always holds that 1 ≤ x_i,y_i,x_g,y_g ≤ N.\nThe connections of fields are given by instances of \"connect\" looking as follows: connect,x,y,d.\n\nAgain, we have 1 ≤ x,y ≤ N. Furthermore, direction d can be \"n\" for north, \"s\" for south, \"e\" for east, or \"w\" for west.\nFinally, the maximum number of pushes is determined by exactly one instance of \"max_steps\": max_steps,m.\n\nArgument m is a positive integer. An exemplary input for the above example looks as follows:\nfield,1,1. ... field,1,4. .... field,4,1. ... field,4,4. init_on,3,2. goal_on,1,4. connect,1,1,s. connect,1,1,w. connect,1,2,n. connect,1,2,e. connect,1,2,w. connect,1,3,e. connect,1,4,n. connect,1,4,w. ... connect,4,4,w. max_steps,2.```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```The starting point is located at (5,21). The following fields have connections to the south: (1, 1), (1, 10), (1, 11), (1, 12), (1, 19), (1, 2), (1, 22), (1, 6). The following fields have connections to the west: (1, 1), (1, 10), (1, 13), (1, 14), (1, 20), (1, 21), (1, 3), (1, 5). The goal field is located at position (5,10).

        "description": "Ravensburger's Labyrinth game deals with guiding an avatar through a dynamically changing labyrinth to certain fields. The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.",

        "description": "Ravensburger's Labyrinth game deals with guiding an avatar through a dynamically changing labyrinth to certain fields. The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.",

        "description": "Ravensburger's Labyrinth game deals with guiding an avatar through a dynamically changing labyrinth to certain fields. The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.",

        "prompt": "Given the following problem description between triple backtips: \n ```Ravensburger's Labyrinth game deals with guiding an avatar through a dynamically changing labyrinth to certain fields. The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```The fields of a quadratic NxN-labyrinth are provided by instances of predicate \"field\" as follows:\nfield,1,1. field,1,2. ... field,1,N. field,2,1. field,2,2. ... field,2,N. ... field,N,1. field,N,2. ... field,N,N.\n\nThe starting and the goal field are specified by exactly one instance of \"init_on\" and exactly one instance of \"goal_on\":\ninit_on,x_i,y_i. goal_on,x_g,y_g.\n\nIt always holds that 1 ≤ x_i,y_i,x_g,y_g ≤ N.\nThe connections of fields are given by instances of \"connect\" looking as follows: connect,x,y,d.\n\nAgain, we have 1 ≤ x,y ≤ N. Furthermore, direction d can be \"n\" for north, \"s\" for south, \"e\" for east, or \"w\" for west.\nFinally, the maximum number of pushes is determined by exactly one instance of \"max_steps\": max_steps,m.\n\nArgument m is a positive integer. An exemplary input for the above example looks as follows:\nfield,1,1. ... field,1,4. .... field,4,1. ... field,4,4. init_on,3,2. goal_on,1,4. connect,1,1,s. connect,1,1,w. connect,1,2,n. connect,1,2,e. connect,1,2,w. connect,1,3,e. connect,1,4,n. connect,1,4,w. ... connect,4,4,w. max_steps,2.```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```The starting coordinates are (6,9). The following fields have connections to the west: (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 8), (10, 8), (11, 10), (11, 2), (11, 5), (11, 6).

        "description": "Ravensburger's Labyrinth game deals with guiding an avatar through a dynamically changing labyrinth to certain fields. The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.",

        "description": "Ravensburger's Labyrinth game deals with guiding an avatar through a dynamically changing labyrinth to certain fields. The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.",

The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.",

        "description": "Ravensburger's Labyrinth game deals with guiding an avatar through a dynamically changing labyrinth to certain fields. The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.",

        "prompt": "Given the following problem description between triple backtips: \n ```Ravensburger's Labyrinth game deals with guiding an avatar through a dynamically changing labyrinth to certain fields. The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```The fields of a quadratic NxN-labyrinth are provided by instances of predicate \"field\" as follows:\nfield,1,1. field,1,2. ... field,1,N. field,2,1. field,2,2. ... field,2,N. ... field,N,1. field,N,2. ... field,N,N.\n\nThe starting and the goal field are specified by exactly one instance of \"init_on\" and exactly one instance of \"goal_on\":\ninit_on,x_i,y_i. goal_on,x_g,y_g.\n\nIt always holds that 1 ≤ x_i,y_i,x_g,y_g ≤ N.\nThe connections of fields are given by instances of \"connect\" looking as follows: connect,x,y,d.\n\nAgain, we have 1 ≤ x,y ≤ N. Furthermore, direction d can be \"n\" for north, \"s\" for south, \"e\" for east, or \"w\" for west.\nFinally, the maximum number of pushes is determined by exactly one instance of \"max_steps\": max_steps,m.\n\nArgument m is a positive integer. An exemplary input for the above example looks as follows:\nfield,1,1. ... field,1,4. .... field,4,1. ... field,4,4. init_on,3,2. goal_on,1,4. connect,1,1,s. connect,1,1,w. connect,1,2,n. connect,1,2,e. connect,1,2,w. connect,1,3,e. connect,1,4,n. connect,1,4,w. ... connect,4,4,w. max_steps,2.```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```The following fields have connections to the north: (1, 11), (1, 12), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (10, 1). The following fields have connections to the south: (1, 1), (1, 10), (1, 11), (1, 12), (1, 14), (1, 15), (1, 2), (1, 3). The goal field is located at position (7,1).

The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.",

An exemplary input for the above example looks as follows:\nfield,1,1. ... field,1,4. .... field,4,1. ... field,4,4. init_on,3,2. goal_on,1,4. connect,1,1,s. connect,1,1,w. connect,1,2,n. connect,1,2,e. connect,1,2,w. connect,1,3,e. connect,1,4,n. connect,1,4,w. ... connect,4,4,w. max_steps,2.```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```The following fields have connections to the south: (1, 1), (1, 13), (1, 16), (1, 18), (1, 19), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 8). At most twenty pushes are permitted. The following fields have connections to the north: (1, 12), (1, 3), (10, 10), (10, 12), (10, 13), (10, 14), (10, 15), (10, 19).

The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.",

        "description": "Ravensburger's Labyrinth game deals with guiding an avatar through a dynamically changing labyrinth to certain fields. The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.",

The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.",

        "description": "Ravensburger's Labyrinth game deals with guiding an avatar through a dynamically changing labyrinth to certain fields. The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.",

        "description": "Ravensburger's Labyrinth game deals with guiding an avatar through a dynamically changing labyrinth to certain fields. The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.",

        "description": "Ravensburger's Labyrinth game deals with guiding an avatar through a dynamically changing labyrinth to certain fields. The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa.

The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```The fields of a quadratic NxN-labyrinth are provided by instances of predicate \"field\" as follows:\nfield,1,1. field,1,2. ... field,1,N. field,2,1. field,2,2. ... field,2,N. ... field,N,1. field,N,2. ... field,N,N.\n\nThe starting and the goal field are specified by exactly one instance of \"init_on\" and exactly one instance of \"goal_on\":\ninit_on,x_i,y_i. goal_on,x_g,y_g.\n\nIt always holds that 1 ≤ x_i,y_i,x_g,y_g ≤ N.\nThe connections of fields are given by instances of \"connect\" looking as follows: connect,x,y,d.\n\nAgain, we have 1 ≤ x,y ≤ N.

        "description": "Ravensburger's Labyrinth game deals with guiding an avatar through a dynamically changing labyrinth to certain fields. The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.",

        "prompt": "Given the following problem description between triple backtips: \n ```Ravensburger's Labyrinth game deals with guiding an avatar through a dynamically changing labyrinth to certain fields. The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```The fields of a quadratic NxN-labyrinth are provided by instances of predicate \"field\" as follows:\nfield,1,1. field,1,2. ... field,1,N. field,2,1. field,2,2. ... field,2,N. ... field,N,1. field,N,2. ... field,N,N.\n\nThe starting and the goal field are specified by exactly one instance of \"init_on\" and exactly one instance of \"goal_on\":\ninit_on,x_i,y_i. goal_on,x_g,y_g.\n\nIt always holds that 1 ≤ x_i,y_i,x_g,y_g ≤ N.\nThe connections of fields are given by instances of \"connect\" looking as follows: connect,x,y,d.\n\nAgain, we have 1 ≤ x,y ≤ N. Furthermore, direction d can be \"n\" for north, \"s\" for south, \"e\" for east, or \"w\" for west.\nFinally, the maximum number of pushes is determined by exactly one instance of \"max_steps\": max_steps,m.\n\nArgument m is a positive integer. An exemplary input for the above example looks as follows:\nfield,1,1. ... field,1,4. .... field,4,1. ... field,4,4. init_on,3,2. goal_on,1,4. connect,1,1,s. connect,1,1,w. connect,1,2,n. connect,1,2,e. connect,1,2,w. connect,1,3,e. connect,1,4,n. connect,1,4,w. ... connect,4,4,w. max_steps,2.```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```The goal field is positioned at (2, 5). The following fields have connections to the south: (1, 1), (1, 11), (1, 17), (1, 18), (1, 19), (1, 20), (1, 3), (1, 5). The starting point is located at (19,16).

        "description": "Ravensburger's Labyrinth game deals with guiding an avatar through a dynamically changing labyrinth to certain fields. The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.",

To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```The fields of a quadratic NxN-labyrinth are provided by instances of predicate \"field\" as follows:\nfield,1,1. field,1,2. ... field,1,N. field,2,1. field,2,2. ... field,2,N. ... field,N,1. field,N,2. ... field,N,N.\n\nThe starting and the goal field are specified by exactly one instance of \"init_on\" and exactly one instance of \"goal_on\":\ninit_on,x_i,y_i. goal_on,x_g,y_g.\n\nIt always holds that 1 ≤ x_i,y_i,x_g,y_g ≤ N.\nThe connections of fields are given by instances of \"connect\" looking as follows: connect,x,y,d.\n\nAgain, we have 1 ≤ x,y ≤ N. Furthermore, direction d can be \"n\" for north, \"s\" for south, \"e\" for east, or \"w\" for west.\nFinally, the maximum number of pushes is determined by exactly one instance of \"max_steps\": max_steps,m.\n\nArgument m is a positive integer. An exemplary input for the above example looks as follows:\nfield,1,1. ... field,1,4. .... field,4,1. ... field,4,4. init_on,3,2. goal_on,1,4. connect,1,1,s. connect,1,1,w. connect,1,2,n. connect,1,2,e. connect,1,2,w. connect,1,3,e. connect,1,4,n. connect,1,4,w. ... connect,4,4,w. max_steps,2.```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```The goal field is placed at (13, 13). The following fields have connections to the west: (1, 10), (1, 11), (1, 12), (1, 17), (1, 18), (1, 20), (1, 4), (1, 5). The following fields have connections to the east: (1, 1), (1, 10), (1, 14), (1, 16), (1, 17), (1, 19), (1, 2), (1, 21). The starting point is located at (13,5). The following fields have connections to the south: (1, 12), (1, 18), (1, 20), (1, 6), (1, 8), (1, 9), (10, 1), (10, 10). A maximum of twenty-one push/es is allowed. The fields of a quadratic 21x21 labyrinth are provided by instances of predicate \"field\" with values from 1 to 21 in both x and y coordinates. The following fields have connections to the north: (1, 13), (1, 15), (1, 17), (1, 20), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9).```\nOutput the result in datalog with no comments, no space between facts and only one fact per line.",

        "description": "Ravensburger's Labyrinth game deals with guiding an avatar through a dynamically changing labyrinth to certain fields. The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions. The shape of the labyrinth changes over time as its rows and columns can be pushed either horizontally or vertically, which involves moving fields out of and into the board. To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.",

(Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```The fields of a quadratic NxN-labyrinth are provided by instances of predicate \"field\" as follows:\nfield,1,1. field,1,2. ... field,1,N. field,2,1. field,2,2. ... field,2,N. ... field,N,1. field,N,2. ... field,N,N.\n\nThe starting and the goal field are specified by exactly one instance of \"init_on\" and exactly one instance of \"goal_on\":\ninit_on,x_i,y_i. goal_on,x_g,y_g.\n\nIt always holds that 1 ≤ x_i,y_i,x_g,y_g ≤ N.\nThe connections of fields are given by instances of \"connect\" looking as follows: connect,x,y,d.\n\nAgain, we have 1 ≤ x,y ≤ N. Furthermore, direction d can be \"n\" for north, \"s\" for south, \"e\" for east, or \"w\" for west.\nFinally, the maximum number of pushes is determined by exactly one instance of \"max_steps\": max_steps,m.\n\nArgument m is a positive integer. An exemplary input for the above example looks as follows:\nfield,1,1. ... field,1,4. .... field,4,1. ... field,4,4. init_on,3,2. goal_on,1,4. connect,1,1,s. connect,1,1,w. connect,1,2,n. connect,1,2,e. connect,1,2,w. connect,1,3,e. connect,1,4,n. connect,1,4,w. ... connect,4,4,w. max_steps,2.```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```The following fields have connections to the south: (1, 10), (1, 12), (1, 14), (1, 2), (1, 20), (1, 21), (1, 3), (1, 5).

The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions.

To get to another field, in each turn, the avatar can follow paths that starting from the avatar's location traverse pairwisely connected fields.\nWe here consider a variation of the original game in which:\n- The field of the labyrinth pushed out of the board (possibly hosting the avatar) immediately returns into the board (possibly with the avatar still residing on it) on the other end of the pushed row or column, respectively.\n- After a push, the avatar can move to any field reachable via a path in which every (non-terminal) field has a connection to its successor, and vice versa. (Note that there always is a path to a field the avatar already resides on.)\n- There is a unique starting and a unique goal field in the labyrinth.\n- A solution is represented by pushes of the labyrinth's rows and columns such that the avatar can from its starting field (which changes its location when pushed) reach the goal field (which also changes its location when pushed) by a move along some path after each push.\n- There is a maximum number of pushes, and the avatar must be able to reach the goal field (which can be relocated by pushes) by moving along some path after each push.\nThe proposed variant of the Labyrinth game is a hard (presumably NP-complete) search problem.",

        "description": "Ravensburger's Labyrinth game deals with guiding an avatar through a dynamically changing labyrinth to certain fields. The labyrinth is represented by a quadratic board whose fields can (but do not have to) be connected in the four cardinal directions.

        "description": "An ubiquitous feature of planning problems is the need to economize limited resources such as fuel or money. While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track). As the domain creator said, this was the most difficult one of the two formulations for planning systems. We retained the Hard version of the problem for the ASP Competition 2013.

        "description": "An ubiquitous feature of planning problems is the need to economize limited resources such as fuel or money. While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track). As the domain creator said, this was the most difficult one of the two formulations for planning systems. We retained the Hard version of the problem for the ASP Competition 2013.

        "description": "An ubiquitous feature of planning problems is the need to economize limited resources such as fuel or money. While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track). As the domain creator said, this was the most difficult one of the two formulations for planning systems. We retained the Hard version of the problem for the ASP Competition 2013.

While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track). As the domain creator said, this was the most difficult one of the two formulations for planning systems. We retained the Hard version of the problem for the ASP Competition 2013.

        "description": "An ubiquitous feature of planning problems is the need to economize limited resources such as fuel or money. While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track). As the domain creator said, this was the most difficult one of the two formulations for planning systems. We retained the Hard version of the problem for the ASP Competition 2013.

While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track).

        "description": "An ubiquitous feature of planning problems is the need to economize limited resources such as fuel or money. While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track). As the domain creator said, this was the most difficult one of the two formulations for planning systems. We retained the Hard version of the problem for the ASP Competition 2013.

        "description": "An ubiquitous feature of planning problems is the need to economize limited resources such as fuel or money. While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track). As the domain creator said, this was the most difficult one of the two formulations for planning systems. We retained the Hard version of the problem for the ASP Competition 2013.

While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track). As the domain creator said, this was the most difficult one of the two formulations for planning systems. We retained the Hard version of the problem for the ASP Competition 2013.

While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track).

While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track).

While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track). As the domain creator said, this was the most difficult one of the two formulations for planning systems. We retained the Hard version of the problem for the ASP Competition 2013.

In detail input assertions are to be interpreted as follows:\n- fuelcost,c,a,b: the locations a and b are connected and the cost for travelling from a to b is c (for c a positive integer) \n- at,o,l: the object o (either a package or a truck) is initially at location\n- l fuel,t,l: the initial fuel available for truck t is l (for l a positive integer) \n- goal,p,l: at the final step, the package p must stay at location\n- l step,s: s is an allowed step, for s a positive integer value\nthe predicate step is intended in order to encode the maximum number of allowed steps. It can be assumed that for 1..n the allowed steps, then step,1 .. step,n assertions hold.```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```The final location for package p5 is l0. The cost of traveling from l2 to l4 is fourteen unit/s. Traveling between locations l0 and l2 costs fifteen unit/s. Initially, p4 is found at location l0. The object p0 is initially at location l1. The last location for package p2 is l4. It cost twelve unit/s for traveling between locations l3 and l2. The package p3 must stay at location l0. A total of eight steps are available: step 1 to step 8. It requires twelve unit/s to travel between l2 and l3. Initially, p2 is found at location l0. The starting location of object t0 is l1. The travel cost between l4 and l2 is fourteen unit/s. The package p4 must remain at location l4. The initial fuel available for truck t0 is sixty-eight. The starting location of object p5 is l5.

While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track). As the domain creator said, this was the most difficult one of the two formulations for planning systems. We retained the Hard version of the problem for the ASP Competition 2013.

According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track). As the domain creator said, this was the most difficult one of the two formulations for planning systems. We retained the Hard version of the problem for the ASP Competition 2013. Instances have only one truck.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```In the setting of the ASP competition, input predicates encode the weighted graph at hand, the initial positions of packages and of the truck, the initial fuel available and the final requested destination for packages. In detail input assertions are to be interpreted as follows:\n- fuelcost,c,a,b: the locations a and b are connected and the cost for travelling from a to b is c (for c a positive integer) \n- at,o,l: the object o (either a package or a truck) is initially at location\n- l fuel,t,l: the initial fuel available for truck t is l (for l a positive integer) \n- goal,p,l: at the final step, the package p must stay at location\n- l step,s: s is an allowed step, for s a positive integer value\nthe predicate step is intended in order to encode the maximum number of allowed steps. It can be assumed that for 1..n the allowed steps, then step,1 .. step,n assertions hold.```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```Traveling between locations l0 and l2 costs twelve unit/s. The cost of traveling from l1 to l6 is thirteen unit/s. The starting location of object p6 is l0. The package p4 must remain at location l1. The object p2 is initially at location l1.

        "description": "An ubiquitous feature of planning problems is the need to economize limited resources such as fuel or money. While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track). As the domain creator said, this was the most difficult one of the two formulations for planning systems. We retained the Hard version of the problem for the ASP Competition 2013.

        "prompt": "Given the following problem description between triple backtips: \n ```An ubiquitous feature of planning problems is the need to economize limited resources such as fuel or money. While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track). As the domain creator said, this was the most difficult one of the two formulations for planning systems. We retained the Hard version of the problem for the ASP Competition 2013. Instances have only one truck.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```In the setting of the ASP competition, input predicates encode the weighted graph at hand, the initial positions of packages and of the truck, the initial fuel available and the final requested destination for packages. In detail input assertions are to be interpreted as follows:\n- fuelcost,c,a,b: the locations a and b are connected and the cost for travelling from a to b is c (for c a positive integer) \n- at,o,l: the object o (either a package or a truck) is initially at location\n- l fuel,t,l: the initial fuel available for truck t is l (for l a positive integer) \n- goal,p,l: at the final step, the package p must stay at location\n- l step,s: s is an allowed step, for s a positive integer value\nthe predicate step is intended in order to encode the maximum number of allowed steps. It can be assumed that for 1..n the allowed steps, then step,1 .. step,n assertions hold.```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```thirteen unit/s are required to travel between locations l6 and l5.

        "prompt": "Given the following problem description between triple backtips: \n ```An ubiquitous feature of planning problems is the need to economize limited resources such as fuel or money. While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track). As the domain creator said, this was the most difficult one of the two formulations for planning systems. We retained the Hard version of the problem for the ASP Competition 2013. Instances have only one truck.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```In the setting of the ASP competition, input predicates encode the weighted graph at hand, the initial positions of packages and of the truck, the initial fuel available and the final requested destination for packages. In detail input assertions are to be interpreted as follows:\n- fuelcost,c,a,b: the locations a and b are connected and the cost for travelling from a to b is c (for c a positive integer) \n- at,o,l: the object o (either a package or a truck) is initially at location\n- l fuel,t,l: the initial fuel available for truck t is l (for l a positive integer) \n- goal,p,l: at the final step, the package p must stay at location\n- l step,s: s is an allowed step, for s a positive integer value\nthe predicate step is intended in order to encode the maximum number of allowed steps. It can be assumed that for 1..n the allowed steps, then step,1 .. step,n assertions hold.```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```The object p4 begins at location l4.

While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost.

        "description": "An ubiquitous feature of planning problems is the need to economize limited resources such as fuel or money. While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track). As the domain creator said, this was the most difficult one of the two formulations for planning systems. We retained the Hard version of the problem for the ASP Competition 2013.

        "description": "An ubiquitous feature of planning problems is the need to economize limited resources such as fuel or money. While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track). As the domain creator said, this was the most difficult one of the two formulations for planning systems. We retained the Hard version of the problem for the ASP Competition 2013.

        "description": "An ubiquitous feature of planning problems is the need to economize limited resources such as fuel or money. While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track). As the domain creator said, this was the most difficult one of the two formulations for planning systems. We retained the Hard version of the problem for the ASP Competition 2013.

        "description": "An ubiquitous feature of planning problems is the need to economize limited resources such as fuel or money. While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track). As the domain creator said, this was the most difficult one of the two formulations for planning systems. We retained the Hard version of the problem for the ASP Competition 2013.

        "description": "An ubiquitous feature of planning problems is the need to economize limited resources such as fuel or money. While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track). As the domain creator said, this was the most difficult one of the two formulations for planning systems. We retained the Hard version of the problem for the ASP Competition 2013.

        "description": "An ubiquitous feature of planning problems is the need to economize limited resources such as fuel or money. While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track). As the domain creator said, this was the most difficult one of the two formulations for planning systems. We retained the Hard version of the problem for the ASP Competition 2013.

        "description": "An ubiquitous feature of planning problems is the need to economize limited resources such as fuel or money. While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track). As the domain creator said, this was the most difficult one of the two formulations for planning systems. We retained the Hard version of the problem for the ASP Competition 2013.

        "description": "An ubiquitous feature of planning problems is the need to economize limited resources such as fuel or money. While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track). As the domain creator said, this was the most difficult one of the two formulations for planning systems. We retained the Hard version of the problem for the ASP Competition 2013.

        "description": "An ubiquitous feature of planning problems is the need to economize limited resources such as fuel or money. While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track). As the domain creator said, this was the most difficult one of the two formulations for planning systems. We retained the Hard version of the problem for the ASP Competition 2013.

        "description": "An ubiquitous feature of planning problems is the need to economize limited resources such as fuel or money. While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track). As the domain creator said, this was the most difficult one of the two formulations for planning systems. We retained the Hard version of the problem for the ASP Competition 2013.

While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track). As the domain creator said, this was the most difficult one of the two formulations for planning systems. We retained the Hard version of the problem for the ASP Competition 2013.

        "description": "An ubiquitous feature of planning problems is the need to economize limited resources such as fuel or money. While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track). As the domain creator said, this was the most difficult one of the two formulations for planning systems. We retained the Hard version of the problem for the ASP Competition 2013.

        "description": "An ubiquitous feature of planning problems is the need to economize limited resources such as fuel or money. While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track). As the domain creator said, this was the most difficult one of the two formulations for planning systems. We retained the Hard version of the problem for the ASP Competition 2013.

        "description": "An ubiquitous feature of planning problems is the need to economize limited resources such as fuel or money. While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track). As the domain creator said, this was the most difficult one of the two formulations for planning systems. We retained the Hard version of the problem for the ASP Competition 2013.

While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track).

Board positions may be occupied by robots of distinct colors, and the goal is to guide some robot to a target position via a sequence of robot moves. A robot can move horizontally or vertically from its current position; once a direction is chosen, the robot moves in that direction until encountering an obstacle, i.e. a barrier, another robot, or the edge of the board, precluding that the robot moves further.

Board positions may be occupied by robots of distinct colors, and the goal is to guide some robot to a target position via a sequence of robot moves. A robot can move horizontally or vertically from its current position; once a direction is chosen, the robot moves in that direction until encountering an obstacle, i.e. a barrier, another robot, or the edge of the board, precluding that the robot moves further.

The start positions of robots are given by pos/3}}, e.g. {{{pos,red,2,3. states that a red robot starts at position (2,3). The locations and orientations of barriers are given by barrier/3, e.g. barrier,4,3,east. states that there is a barrier between position (4,3) and position (5,3); note that the same barrier is also represented by barrier,5,3,west., and a problem instance may include either or both representations. In any atom of the form barrier,x,y,d, a value \"east\", \"west\", \"south\", or \"north\" of d indicates a neighboring position (x+1,y), (x-1,y), (x,y+1), or (x,y-1), respectively, of position (x,y) on the board. The color and location of a target are given by target/3, e.g. target,red,4,3. states that the red robot should be guided to position (4,3). The number of moves in a plan is given by length/1, e.g. length,3. for a plan of three moves. A problem instance contains exactly one fact of the form length,l. and exactly one fact of the form target,c,x,y.; the color name c appears also in some fact of the form pos,c,x',y'., and there is exactly one fact pos,c',x',y'. per color name c' such that no distinct colors share the same start position (x',y').```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```The number of moves in the plan is must be sixteen.

While the original objective of the game is to achieve the goal with a minimum number of moves, we consider a decision version, viz. whether the goal can be established via some sequence (a plan) consisting of a predefined number of robot moves.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```The dimensions of a quadratic board are given by dim/1, e.g. dim,1. dim,2. dim,3. for a 3x3 board. The start positions of robots are given by pos/3}}, e.g. {{{pos,red,2,3. states that a red robot starts at position (2,3). The locations and orientations of barriers are given by barrier/3, e.g. barrier,4,3,east. states that there is a barrier between position (4,3) and position (5,3); note that the same barrier is also represented by barrier,5,3,west., and a problem instance may include either or both representations. In any atom of the form barrier,x,y,d, a value \"east\", \"west\", \"south\", or \"north\" of d indicates a neighboring position (x+1,y), (x-1,y), (x,y+1), or (x,y-1), respectively, of position (x,y) on the board. The color and location of a target are given by target/3, e.g. target,red,4,3. states that the red robot should be guided to position (4,3). The number of moves in a plan is given by length/1, e.g. length,3. for a plan of three moves. A problem instance contains exactly one fact of the form length,l. and exactly one fact of the form target,c,x,y.; the color name c appears also in some fact of the form pos,c,x',y'., and there is exactly one fact pos,c',x',y'. per color name c' such that no distinct colors share the same start position (x',y').```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```There is a barrier between position (10,9) and position (9,9) heading west.

In any atom of the form barrier,x,y,d, a value \"east\", \"west\", \"south\", or \"north\" of d indicates a neighboring position (x+1,y), (x-1,y), (x,y+1), or (x,y-1), respectively, of position (x,y) on the board. The color and location of a target are given by target/3, e.g. target,red,4,3. states that the red robot should be guided to position (4,3). The number of moves in a plan is given by length/1, e.g. length,3. for a plan of three moves. A problem instance contains exactly one fact of the form length,l. and exactly one fact of the form target,c,x,y.; the color name c appears also in some fact of the form pos,c,x',y'., and there is exactly one fact pos,c',x',y'. per color name c' such that no distinct colors share the same start position (x',y').```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```A barrier exists between position (10,15) and position (11,15) in the direction of east.

The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations.

This information is encoded as facts using predicates movedir/3, goal/1, stone/1, isgoal/2, player/1, at/2, clear/2 as follows:\n\nmovedir,x,y,dir: y is a location reachable by location x by moving towards direction dir, where dir can be one of 'dir_up','dir_down','dir_left','dir_right'.\n\ngoal,s: the stone s must be put in a goal location stone,s: s is a stone isgoal,l: l is a goal location isnongoal,l: l is not a goal location. This information can be obtained by complehementing information given by isgoal, but it has been retained for compatibility with the IPC 2011 domain description. player,p: p is the sokoban. at,o,p: the object o (either the sokoban or a stone) is initially at position p. clear,p: the floor location p is clear of objects.\n\nEach instance has exactly one fact for player/1. There can be in principle non-goal stones (i.e. there can be s such that stone,s holds, but not goal,s).\n\nAn instance also contains a sequence of time-steps for warehouse configurations, between which the actions occur:\n\nstep,s: s is an allowed step. It can be assumed steps are consecutive integers ranging from 1 towards a limit value N. Steps are associated to actions. It's up to problem modeller's how to treat properly the presence of N+1 intermediate states.```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```The stone stone_02 must be moved to a goal location.

This year the problem specifications were adapted in order to adhere to the specifications of the homologous problem used at IPC 2011 and 2008, in order to achieve a clearer comparative picture between planners and ASP solvers.\nSokoban is a game puzzle developed by the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. in 1982. 'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box). The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations. To this end, the sokoban can walk on floor locations (unless occupied by some box), and push single boxes onto unoccupied floor locations.\nIn the decision version of this problem, the question to answer is whether a solution involving at most N actions exists, for N given as input. If so, a witness containing the sequence of actions should be produced; otherwise no solution should be output.",
        "format": "In our setting, an instance contains the warehouse layout, representing the floor locations, and in particular their horizontal and vertical relationships; storage locations, where the boxes should eventually go to; and, initial positions of stones and the sokoban. This information is encoded as facts using predicates movedir/3, goal/1, stone/1, isgoal/2, player/1, at/2, clear/2 as follows:\n\nmovedir,x,y,dir: y is a location reachable by location x by moving towards direction dir, where dir can be one of 'dir_up','dir_down','dir_left','dir_right'.\n\ngoal,s: the stone s must be put in a goal location stone,s: s is a stone isgoal,l: l is a goal location isnongoal,l: l is not a goal location. This information can be obtained by complehementing information given by isgoal, but it has been retained for compatibility with the IPC 2011 domain description. player,p: p is the sokoban. at,o,p: the object o (either the sokoban or a stone) is initially at position p. clear,p: the floor location p is clear of objects.\n\nEach instance has exactly one fact for player/1. There can be in principle non-goal stones (i.e. there can be s such that stone,s holds, but not goal,s).\n\nAn instance also contains a sequence of time-steps for warehouse configurations, between which the actions occur:\n\nstep,s: s is an allowed step. It can be assumed steps are consecutive integers ranging from 1 towards a limit value N. Steps are associated to actions. It's up to problem modeller's how to treat properly the presence of N+1 intermediate states.",

        "prompt": "Given the following problem description between triple backtips: \n ```Sokoban is a classic problem which appeared so far in all the ASP Competitions. This year the problem specifications were adapted in order to adhere to the specifications of the homologous problem used at IPC 2011 and 2008, in order to achieve a clearer comparative picture between planners and ASP solvers.\nSokoban is a game puzzle developed by the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. in 1982. 'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box). The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations. To this end, the sokoban can walk on floor locations (unless occupied by some box), and push single boxes onto unoccupied floor locations.\nIn the decision version of this problem, the question to answer is whether a solution involving at most N actions exists, for N given as input. If so, a witness containing the sequence of actions should be produced; otherwise no solution should be output.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```In our setting, an instance contains the warehouse layout, representing the floor locations, and in particular their horizontal and vertical relationships; storage locations, where the boxes should eventually go to; and, initial positions of stones and the sokoban. This information is encoded as facts using predicates movedir/3, goal/1, stone/1, isgoal/2, player/1, at/2, clear/2 as follows:\n\nmovedir,x,y,dir: y is a location reachable by location x by moving towards direction dir, where dir can be one of 'dir_up','dir_down','dir_left','dir_right'.\n\ngoal,s: the stone s must be put in a goal location stone,s: s is a stone isgoal,l: l is a goal location isnongoal,l: l is not a goal location. This information can be obtained by complehementing information given by isgoal, but it has been retained for compatibility with the IPC 2011 domain description. player,p: p is the sokoban. at,o,p: the object o (either the sokoban or a stone) is initially at position p. clear,p: the floor location p is clear of objects.\n\nEach instance has exactly one fact for player/1. There can be in principle non-goal stones (i.e. there can be s such that stone,s holds, but not goal,s).\n\nAn instance also contains a sequence of time-steps for warehouse configurations, between which the actions occur:\n\nstep,s: s is an allowed step. It can be assumed steps are consecutive integers ranging from 1 towards a limit value N. Steps are associated to actions. It's up to problem modeller's how to treat properly the presence of N+1 intermediate states.```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```The stone stone_03 should be placed in a goal location.

This year the problem specifications were adapted in order to adhere to the specifications of the homologous problem used at IPC 2011 and 2008, in order to achieve a clearer comparative picture between planners and ASP solvers.\nSokoban is a game puzzle developed by the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. in 1982. 'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box). The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations. To this end, the sokoban can walk on floor locations (unless occupied by some box), and push single boxes onto unoccupied floor locations.\nIn the decision version of this problem, the question to answer is whether a solution involving at most N actions exists, for N given as input. If so, a witness containing the sequence of actions should be produced; otherwise no solution should be output.",

        "description": "Sokoban is a classic problem which appeared so far in all the ASP Competitions. This year the problem specifications were adapted in order to adhere to the specifications of the homologous problem used at IPC 2011 and 2008, in order to achieve a clearer comparative picture between planners and ASP solvers.\nSokoban is a game puzzle developed by the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. in 1982. 'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box). The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations. To this end, the sokoban can walk on floor locations (unless occupied by some box), and push single boxes onto unoccupied floor locations.\nIn the decision version of this problem, the question to answer is whether a solution involving at most N actions exists, for N given as input. If so, a witness containing the sequence of actions should be produced; otherwise no solution should be output.",
        "format": "In our setting, an instance contains the warehouse layout, representing the floor locations, and in particular their horizontal and vertical relationships; storage locations, where the boxes should eventually go to; and, initial positions of stones and the sokoban. This information is encoded as facts using predicates movedir/3, goal/1, stone/1, isgoal/2, player/1, at/2, clear/2 as follows:\n\nmovedir,x,y,dir: y is a location reachable by location x by moving towards direction dir, where dir can be one of 'dir_up','dir_down','dir_left','dir_right'.\n\ngoal,s: the stone s must be put in a goal location stone,s: s is a stone isgoal,l: l is a goal location isnongoal,l: l is not a goal location. This information can be obtained by complehementing information given by isgoal, but it has been retained for compatibility with the IPC 2011 domain description. player,p: p is the sokoban. at,o,p: the object o (either the sokoban or a stone) is initially at position p. clear,p: the floor location p is clear of objects.\n\nEach instance has exactly one fact for player/1. There can be in principle non-goal stones (i.e. there can be s such that stone,s holds, but not goal,s).\n\nAn instance also contains a sequence of time-steps for warehouse configurations, between which the actions occur:\n\nstep,s: s is an allowed step.

        "prompt": "Given the following problem description between triple backtips: \n ```Sokoban is a classic problem which appeared so far in all the ASP Competitions. This year the problem specifications were adapted in order to adhere to the specifications of the homologous problem used at IPC 2011 and 2008, in order to achieve a clearer comparative picture between planners and ASP solvers.\nSokoban is a game puzzle developed by the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. in 1982. 'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box). The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations. To this end, the sokoban can walk on floor locations (unless occupied by some box), and push single boxes onto unoccupied floor locations.\nIn the decision version of this problem, the question to answer is whether a solution involving at most N actions exists, for N given as input. If so, a witness containing the sequence of actions should be produced; otherwise no solution should be output.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```In our setting, an instance contains the warehouse layout, representing the floor locations, and in particular their horizontal and vertical relationships; storage locations, where the boxes should eventually go to; and, initial positions of stones and the sokoban. This information is encoded as facts using predicates movedir/3, goal/1, stone/1, isgoal/2, player/1, at/2, clear/2 as follows:\n\nmovedir,x,y,dir: y is a location reachable by location x by moving towards direction dir, where dir can be one of 'dir_up','dir_down','dir_left','dir_right'.\n\ngoal,s: the stone s must be put in a goal location stone,s: s is a stone isgoal,l: l is a goal location isnongoal,l: l is not a goal location. This information can be obtained by complehementing information given by isgoal, but it has been retained for compatibility with the IPC 2011 domain description. player,p: p is the sokoban. at,o,p: the object o (either the sokoban or a stone) is initially at position p. clear,p: the floor location p is clear of objects.\n\nEach instance has exactly one fact for player/1. There can be in principle non-goal stones (i.e. there can be s such that stone,s holds, but not goal,s).\n\nAn instance also contains a sequence of time-steps for warehouse configurations, between which the actions occur:\n\nstep,s: s is an allowed step. It can be assumed steps are consecutive integers ranging from 1 towards a limit value N. Steps are associated to actions. It's up to problem modeller's how to treat properly the presence of N+1 intermediate states.```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```Stone stone_02 has to be positioned in a goal location. We can move from location pos_2_4 to location pos_2_3 by moving towards direction dir_up.

        "description": "Sokoban is a classic problem which appeared so far in all the ASP Competitions. This year the problem specifications were adapted in order to adhere to the specifications of the homologous problem used at IPC 2011 and 2008, in order to achieve a clearer comparative picture between planners and ASP solvers.\nSokoban is a game puzzle developed by the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. in 1982. 'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box). The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations. To this end, the sokoban can walk on floor locations (unless occupied by some box), and push single boxes onto unoccupied floor locations.\nIn the decision version of this problem, the question to answer is whether a solution involving at most N actions exists, for N given as input. If so, a witness containing the sequence of actions should be produced; otherwise no solution should be output.",
        "format": "In our setting, an instance contains the warehouse layout, representing the floor locations, and in particular their horizontal and vertical relationships; storage locations, where the boxes should eventually go to; and, initial positions of stones and the sokoban. This information is encoded as facts using predicates movedir/3, goal/1, stone/1, isgoal/2, player/1, at/2, clear/2 as follows:\n\nmovedir,x,y,dir: y is a location reachable by location x by moving towards direction dir, where dir can be one of 'dir_up','dir_down','dir_left','dir_right'.\n\ngoal,s: the stone s must be put in a goal location stone,s: s is a stone isgoal,l: l is a goal location isnongoal,l: l is not a goal location. This information can be obtained by complehementing information given by isgoal, but it has been retained for compatibility with the IPC 2011 domain description. player,p: p is the sokoban. at,o,p: the object o (either the sokoban or a stone) is initially at position p. clear,p: the floor location p is clear of objects.\n\nEach instance has exactly one fact for player/1. There can be in principle non-goal stones (i.e. there can be s such that stone,s holds, but not goal,s).\n\nAn instance also contains a sequence of time-steps for warehouse configurations, between which the actions occur:\n\nstep,s: s is an allowed step. It can be assumed steps are consecutive integers ranging from 1 towards a limit value N. Steps are associated to actions. It's up to problem modeller's how to treat properly the presence of N+1 intermediate states.",

        "prompt": "Given the following problem description between triple backtips: \n ```Sokoban is a classic problem which appeared so far in all the ASP Competitions. This year the problem specifications were adapted in order to adhere to the specifications of the homologous problem used at IPC 2011 and 2008, in order to achieve a clearer comparative picture between planners and ASP solvers.\nSokoban is a game puzzle developed by the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. in 1982. 'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box). The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations. To this end, the sokoban can walk on floor locations (unless occupied by some box), and push single boxes onto unoccupied floor locations.\nIn the decision version of this problem, the question to answer is whether a solution involving at most N actions exists, for N given as input. If so, a witness containing the sequence of actions should be produced; otherwise no solution should be output.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```In our setting, an instance contains the warehouse layout, representing the floor locations, and in particular their horizontal and vertical relationships; storage locations, where the boxes should eventually go to; and, initial positions of stones and the sokoban. This information is encoded as facts using predicates movedir/3, goal/1, stone/1, isgoal/2, player/1, at/2, clear/2 as follows:\n\nmovedir,x,y,dir: y is a location reachable by location x by moving towards direction dir, where dir can be one of 'dir_up','dir_down','dir_left','dir_right'.\n\ngoal,s: the stone s must be put in a goal location stone,s: s is a stone isgoal,l: l is a goal location isnongoal,l: l is not a goal location. This information can be obtained by complehementing information given by isgoal, but it has been retained for compatibility with the IPC 2011 domain description. player,p: p is the sokoban. at,o,p: the object o (either the sokoban or a stone) is initially at position p. clear,p: the floor location p is clear of objects.\n\nEach instance has exactly one fact for player/1. There can be in principle non-goal stones (i.e. there can be s such that stone,s holds, but not goal,s).\n\nAn instance also contains a sequence of time-steps for warehouse configurations, between which the actions occur:\n\nstep,s: s is an allowed step. It can be assumed steps are consecutive integers ranging from 1 towards a limit value N. Steps are associated to actions. It's up to problem modeller's how to treat properly the presence of N+1 intermediate states.```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```Stone stone_01 has to be positioned in a goal location. stone_02 is initially at position pos_3_5.

        "description": "Sokoban is a classic problem which appeared so far in all the ASP Competitions. This year the problem specifications were adapted in order to adhere to the specifications of the homologous problem used at IPC 2011 and 2008, in order to achieve a clearer comparative picture between planners and ASP solvers.\nSokoban is a game puzzle developed by the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. in 1982. 'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box). The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations. To this end, the sokoban can walk on floor locations (unless occupied by some box), and push single boxes onto unoccupied floor locations.\nIn the decision version of this problem, the question to answer is whether a solution involving at most N actions exists, for N given as input. If so, a witness containing the sequence of actions should be produced; otherwise no solution should be output.",
        "format": "In our setting, an instance contains the warehouse layout, representing the floor locations, and in particular their horizontal and vertical relationships; storage locations, where the boxes should eventually go to; and, initial positions of stones and the sokoban. This information is encoded as facts using predicates movedir/3, goal/1, stone/1, isgoal/2, player/1, at/2, clear/2 as follows:\n\nmovedir,x,y,dir: y is a location reachable by location x by moving towards direction dir, where dir can be one of 'dir_up','dir_down','dir_left','dir_right'.\n\ngoal,s: the stone s must be put in a goal location stone,s: s is a stone isgoal,l: l is a goal location isnongoal,l: l is not a goal location.

        "prompt": "Given the following problem description between triple backtips: \n ```Sokoban is a classic problem which appeared so far in all the ASP Competitions. This year the problem specifications were adapted in order to adhere to the specifications of the homologous problem used at IPC 2011 and 2008, in order to achieve a clearer comparative picture between planners and ASP solvers.\nSokoban is a game puzzle developed by the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. in 1982. 'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box). The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations. To this end, the sokoban can walk on floor locations (unless occupied by some box), and push single boxes onto unoccupied floor locations.\nIn the decision version of this problem, the question to answer is whether a solution involving at most N actions exists, for N given as input. If so, a witness containing the sequence of actions should be produced; otherwise no solution should be output.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```In our setting, an instance contains the warehouse layout, representing the floor locations, and in particular their horizontal and vertical relationships; storage locations, where the boxes should eventually go to; and, initial positions of stones and the sokoban. This information is encoded as facts using predicates movedir/3, goal/1, stone/1, isgoal/2, player/1, at/2, clear/2 as follows:\n\nmovedir,x,y,dir: y is a location reachable by location x by moving towards direction dir, where dir can be one of 'dir_up','dir_down','dir_left','dir_right'.\n\ngoal,s: the stone s must be put in a goal location stone,s: s is a stone isgoal,l: l is a goal location isnongoal,l: l is not a goal location. This information can be obtained by complehementing information given by isgoal, but it has been retained for compatibility with the IPC 2011 domain description. player,p: p is the sokoban. at,o,p: the object o (either the sokoban or a stone) is initially at position p. clear,p: the floor location p is clear of objects.\n\nEach instance has exactly one fact for player/1. There can be in principle non-goal stones (i.e. there can be s such that stone,s holds, but not goal,s).\n\nAn instance also contains a sequence of time-steps for warehouse configurations, between which the actions occur:\n\nstep,s: s is an allowed step. It can be assumed steps are consecutive integers ranging from 1 towards a limit value N. Steps are associated to actions. It's up to problem modeller's how to treat properly the presence of N+1 intermediate states.```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```The following floor locations are clear of objects: pos_1_1, pos_1_2, pos_2_4, pos_2_5, pos_3_2, pos_3_3, pos_3_5, pos_4_2.

'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box). The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations. To this end, the sokoban can walk on floor locations (unless occupied by some box), and push single boxes onto unoccupied floor locations.\nIn the decision version of this problem, the question to answer is whether a solution involving at most N actions exists, for N given as input.

This information is encoded as facts using predicates movedir/3, goal/1, stone/1, isgoal/2, player/1, at/2, clear/2 as follows:\n\nmovedir,x,y,dir: y is a location reachable by location x by moving towards direction dir, where dir can be one of 'dir_up','dir_down','dir_left','dir_right'.\n\ngoal,s: the stone s must be put in a goal location stone,s: s is a stone isgoal,l: l is a goal location isnongoal,l: l is not a goal location. This information can be obtained by complehementing information given by isgoal, but it has been retained for compatibility with the IPC 2011 domain description. player,p: p is the sokoban. at,o,p: the object o (either the sokoban or a stone) is initially at position p. clear,p: the floor location p is clear of objects.\n\nEach instance has exactly one fact for player/1. There can be in principle non-goal stones (i.e. there can be s such that stone,s holds, but not goal,s).\n\nAn instance also contains a sequence of time-steps for warehouse configurations, between which the actions occur:\n\nstep,s: s is an allowed step. It can be assumed steps are consecutive integers ranging from 1 towards a limit value N. Steps are associated to actions. It's up to problem modeller's how to treat properly the presence of N+1 intermediate states.```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```The stone stone_02 should be placed in a goal location. The following are goal locations where the stones must be placed: pos_4_5, pos_5_5, pos_6_5. The stone stone_03 should be placed in a goal location. The initial position of stone_03 is pos_3_4.

This year the problem specifications were adapted in order to adhere to the specifications of the homologous problem used at IPC 2011 and 2008, in order to achieve a clearer comparative picture between planners and ASP solvers.\nSokoban is a game puzzle developed by the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. in 1982. 'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box). The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations. To this end, the sokoban can walk on floor locations (unless occupied by some box), and push single boxes onto unoccupied floor locations.\nIn the decision version of this problem, the question to answer is whether a solution involving at most N actions exists, for N given as input. If so, a witness containing the sequence of actions should be produced; otherwise no solution should be output.",

        "description": "Sokoban is a classic problem which appeared so far in all the ASP Competitions. This year the problem specifications were adapted in order to adhere to the specifications of the homologous problem used at IPC 2011 and 2008, in order to achieve a clearer comparative picture between planners and ASP solvers.\nSokoban is a game puzzle developed by the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. in 1982. 'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box). The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations.

This year the problem specifications were adapted in order to adhere to the specifications of the homologous problem used at IPC 2011 and 2008, in order to achieve a clearer comparative picture between planners and ASP solvers.\nSokoban is a game puzzle developed by the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. in 1982. 'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box). The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations. To this end, the sokoban can walk on floor locations (unless occupied by some box), and push single boxes onto unoccupied floor locations.\nIn the decision version of this problem, the question to answer is whether a solution involving at most N actions exists, for N given as input. If so, a witness containing the sequence of actions should be produced; otherwise no solution should be output.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```In our setting, an instance contains the warehouse layout, representing the floor locations, and in particular their horizontal and vertical relationships; storage locations, where the boxes should eventually go to; and, initial positions of stones and the sokoban.

        "description": "Sokoban is a classic problem which appeared so far in all the ASP Competitions. This year the problem specifications were adapted in order to adhere to the specifications of the homologous problem used at IPC 2011 and 2008, in order to achieve a clearer comparative picture between planners and ASP solvers.\nSokoban is a game puzzle developed by the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. in 1982. 'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box). The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations. To this end, the sokoban can walk on floor locations (unless occupied by some box), and push single boxes onto unoccupied floor locations.\nIn the decision version of this problem, the question to answer is whether a solution involving at most N actions exists, for N given as input. If so, a witness containing the sequence of actions should be produced; otherwise no solution should be output.",

        "prompt": "Given the following problem description between triple backtips: \n ```Sokoban is a classic problem which appeared so far in all the ASP Competitions. This year the problem specifications were adapted in order to adhere to the specifications of the homologous problem used at IPC 2011 and 2008, in order to achieve a clearer comparative picture between planners and ASP solvers.\nSokoban is a game puzzle developed by the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. in 1982. 'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box). The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations. To this end, the sokoban can walk on floor locations (unless occupied by some box), and push single boxes onto unoccupied floor locations.\nIn the decision version of this problem, the question to answer is whether a solution involving at most N actions exists, for N given as input. If so, a witness containing the sequence of actions should be produced; otherwise no solution should be output.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```In our setting, an instance contains the warehouse layout, representing the floor locations, and in particular their horizontal and vertical relationships; storage locations, where the boxes should eventually go to; and, initial positions of stones and the sokoban. This information is encoded as facts using predicates movedir/3, goal/1, stone/1, isgoal/2, player/1, at/2, clear/2 as follows:\n\nmovedir,x,y,dir: y is a location reachable by location x by moving towards direction dir, where dir can be one of 'dir_up','dir_down','dir_left','dir_right'.\n\ngoal,s: the stone s must be put in a goal location stone,s: s is a stone isgoal,l: l is a goal location isnongoal,l: l is not a goal location.

This year the problem specifications were adapted in order to adhere to the specifications of the homologous problem used at IPC 2011 and 2008, in order to achieve a clearer comparative picture between planners and ASP solvers.\nSokoban is a game puzzle developed by the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. in 1982. 'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box). The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations. To this end, the sokoban can walk on floor locations (unless occupied by some box), and push single boxes onto unoccupied floor locations.\nIn the decision version of this problem, the question to answer is whether a solution involving at most N actions exists, for N given as input. If so, a witness containing the sequence of actions should be produced; otherwise no solution should be output.",

        "description": "Sokoban is a classic problem which appeared so far in all the ASP Competitions. This year the problem specifications were adapted in order to adhere to the specifications of the homologous problem used at IPC 2011 and 2008, in order to achieve a clearer comparative picture between planners and ASP solvers.\nSokoban is a game puzzle developed by the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. in 1982. 'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box). The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations. To this end, the sokoban can walk on floor locations (unless occupied by some box), and push single boxes onto unoccupied floor locations.\nIn the decision version of this problem, the question to answer is whether a solution involving at most N actions exists, for N given as input. If so, a witness containing the sequence of actions should be produced; otherwise no solution should be output.",
        "format": "In our setting, an instance contains the warehouse layout, representing the floor locations, and in particular their horizontal and vertical relationships; storage locations, where the boxes should eventually go to; and, initial positions of stones and the sokoban. This information is encoded as facts using predicates movedir/3, goal/1, stone/1, isgoal/2, player/1, at/2, clear/2 as follows:\n\nmovedir,x,y,dir: y is a location reachable by location x by moving towards direction dir, where dir can be one of 'dir_up','dir_down','dir_left','dir_right'.\n\ngoal,s: the stone s must be put in a goal location stone,s: s is a stone isgoal,l: l is a goal location isnongoal,l: l is not a goal location. This information can be obtained by complehementing information given by isgoal, but it has been retained for compatibility with the IPC 2011 domain description. player,p: p is the sokoban. at,o,p: the object o (either the sokoban or a stone) is initially at position p. clear,p: the floor location p is clear of objects.\n\nEach instance has exactly one fact for player/1. There can be in principle non-goal stones (i.e. there can be s such that stone,s holds, but not goal,s).\n\nAn instance also contains a sequence of time-steps for warehouse configurations, between which the actions occur:\n\nstep,s: s is an allowed step. It can be assumed steps are consecutive integers ranging from 1 towards a limit value N. Steps are associated to actions. It's up to problem modeller's how to treat properly the presence of N+1 intermediate states.",

        "prompt": "Given the following problem description between triple backtips: \n ```Sokoban is a classic problem which appeared so far in all the ASP Competitions. This year the problem specifications were adapted in order to adhere to the specifications of the homologous problem used at IPC 2011 and 2008, in order to achieve a clearer comparative picture between planners and ASP solvers.\nSokoban is a game puzzle developed by the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. in 1982. 'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box). The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations. To this end, the sokoban can walk on floor locations (unless occupied by some box), and push single boxes onto unoccupied floor locations.\nIn the decision version of this problem, the question to answer is whether a solution involving at most N actions exists, for N given as input. If so, a witness containing the sequence of actions should be produced; otherwise no solution should be output.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```In our setting, an instance contains the warehouse layout, representing the floor locations, and in particular their horizontal and vertical relationships; storage locations, where the boxes should eventually go to; and, initial positions of stones and the sokoban. This information is encoded as facts using predicates movedir/3, goal/1, stone/1, isgoal/2, player/1, at/2, clear/2 as follows:\n\nmovedir,x,y,dir: y is a location reachable by location x by moving towards direction dir, where dir can be one of 'dir_up','dir_down','dir_left','dir_right'.\n\ngoal,s: the stone s must be put in a goal location stone,s: s is a stone isgoal,l: l is a goal location isnongoal,l: l is not a goal location. This information can be obtained by complehementing information given by isgoal, but it has been retained for compatibility with the IPC 2011 domain description. player,p: p is the sokoban. at,o,p: the object o (either the sokoban or a stone) is initially at position p. clear,p: the floor location p is clear of objects.\n\nEach instance has exactly one fact for player/1. There can be in principle non-goal stones (i.e. there can be s such that stone,s holds, but not goal,s).\n\nAn instance also contains a sequence of time-steps for warehouse configurations, between which the actions occur:\n\nstep,s: s is an allowed step. It can be assumed steps are consecutive integers ranging from 1 towards a limit value N. Steps are associated to actions. It's up to problem modeller's how to treat properly the presence of N+1 intermediate states.```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```Location pos_3_3 can be reached from location pos_2_3 by moving towards direction dir_right.

This year the problem specifications were adapted in order to adhere to the specifications of the homologous problem used at IPC 2011 and 2008, in order to achieve a clearer comparative picture between planners and ASP solvers.\nSokoban is a game puzzle developed by the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. in 1982. 'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box). The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations. To this end, the sokoban can walk on floor locations (unless occupied by some box), and push single boxes onto unoccupied floor locations.\nIn the decision version of this problem, the question to answer is whether a solution involving at most N actions exists, for N given as input. If so, a witness containing the sequence of actions should be produced; otherwise no solution should be output.",
        "format": "In our setting, an instance contains the warehouse layout, representing the floor locations, and in particular their horizontal and vertical relationships; storage locations, where the boxes should eventually go to; and, initial positions of stones and the sokoban. This information is encoded as facts using predicates movedir/3, goal/1, stone/1, isgoal/2, player/1, at/2, clear/2 as follows:\n\nmovedir,x,y,dir: y is a location reachable by location x by moving towards direction dir, where dir can be one of 'dir_up','dir_down','dir_left','dir_right'.\n\ngoal,s: the stone s must be put in a goal location stone,s: s is a stone isgoal,l: l is a goal location isnongoal,l: l is not a goal location. This information can be obtained by complehementing information given by isgoal, but it has been retained for compatibility with the IPC 2011 domain description. player,p: p is the sokoban. at,o,p: the object o (either the sokoban or a stone) is initially at position p. clear,p: the floor location p is clear of objects.\n\nEach instance has exactly one fact for player/1. There can be in principle non-goal stones (i.e. there can be s such that stone,s holds, but not goal,s).\n\nAn instance also contains a sequence of time-steps for warehouse configurations, between which the actions occur:\n\nstep,s: s is an allowed step. It can be assumed steps are consecutive integers ranging from 1 towards a limit value N. Steps are associated to actions. It's up to problem modeller's how to treat properly the presence of N+1 intermediate states.",

        "prompt": "Given the following problem description between triple backtips: \n ```Sokoban is a classic problem which appeared so far in all the ASP Competitions. This year the problem specifications were adapted in order to adhere to the specifications of the homologous problem used at IPC 2011 and 2008, in order to achieve a clearer comparative picture between planners and ASP solvers.\nSokoban is a game puzzle developed by the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. in 1982. 'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box). The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations. To this end, the sokoban can walk on floor locations (unless occupied by some box), and push single boxes onto unoccupied floor locations.\nIn the decision version of this problem, the question to answer is whether a solution involving at most N actions exists, for N given as input. If so, a witness containing the sequence of actions should be produced; otherwise no solution should be output.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```In our setting, an instance contains the warehouse layout, representing the floor locations, and in particular their horizontal and vertical relationships; storage locations, where the boxes should eventually go to; and, initial positions of stones and the sokoban. This information is encoded as facts using predicates movedir/3, goal/1, stone/1, isgoal/2, player/1, at/2, clear/2 as follows:\n\nmovedir,x,y,dir: y is a location reachable by location x by moving towards direction dir, where dir can be one of 'dir_up','dir_down','dir_left','dir_right'.\n\ngoal,s: the stone s must be put in a goal location stone,s: s is a stone isgoal,l: l is a goal location isnongoal,l: l is not a goal location. This information can be obtained by complehementing information given by isgoal, but it has been retained for compatibility with the IPC 2011 domain description. player,p: p is the sokoban. at,o,p: the object o (either the sokoban or a stone) is initially at position p. clear,p: the floor location p is clear of objects.\n\nEach instance has exactly one fact for player/1. There can be in principle non-goal stones (i.e. there can be s such that stone,s holds, but not goal,s).\n\nAn instance also contains a sequence of time-steps for warehouse configurations, between which the actions occur:\n\nstep,s: s is an allowed step. It can be assumed steps are consecutive integers ranging from 1 towards a limit value N. Steps are associated to actions. It's up to problem modeller's how to treat properly the presence of N+1 intermediate states.```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```Initially, player_01 is located at position pos_5_6. stone_01 is initially at position pos_5_4. The stone stone_01 should be placed in a goal location. To move from location pos_2_5 to location pos_2_4, go in direction dir_up. There is/are eight amount of allowed step/s.
