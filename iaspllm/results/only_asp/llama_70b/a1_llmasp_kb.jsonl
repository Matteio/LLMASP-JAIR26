However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track).

While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track).

While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track).

While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track).

While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track).

While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track).

While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track).

While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2].

Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost.

While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions.

While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track).

While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2]. Hard-cost encoding makes the problems easier for the current planners. The reason is that the heuristic functions that consider costs are not any more completely ignorant to the resource consumption of actions. However, this type of encoding is not always feasible for resource planning; there might be several resources and the cost of the plan might be different from the amount of the resource consumption. However, our initial experiments show problems in this encoding with 12 locations and 15 packages become challenging for current planners when C is close to 1.\nFrom the two versions of the domain only the Hard one (where cost of the plan and resource consumption are not related) has been considered at IPC 2011 (Deterministic Track).

While heuristic search, mostly based on relaxation heuristics, is currently the superior method for most varieties of planning, its ability to solve critically resource-constrained problems is limited: relaxation heuristics basically ignore the resource consumption by actions. Nomystery is a nice test domain to study the behavior of planning algorithms in planning problems with resources.\nIn Nomystery, a truck moves in a weighted graph where a set of packages must be transported between nodes. Actions move the truck along edges and load/unload packages. Each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The initial fuel supply is set to C * M where M is the minimum required amount of fuel, calculated using a domain-specific optimal solver, and C >= 1 is a (float) input parameter that denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The closer C to 1, the more constrained the problem. If C=1only the optimal plan solves the problem.\nThe authors originally provided two versions of the domain, called Hard and Hard-cost. They differ only in the cost of the actions. In the first one, all the actions have unitary cost, while in the second version the cost of moving a track equals the fuel consumed. According to the author:\nIn the Hard encoding, problems with 12 locations and 12 packages become quite challenging for state-of-the-art planners when C is close to 1 [2].

The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations. To this end, the sokoban can walk on floor locations (unless occupied by some box), and push single boxes onto unoccupied floor locations.\nIn the decision version of this problem, the question to answer is whether a solution involving at most N actions exists, for N given as input.

If so, a witness containing the sequence of actions should be produced; otherwise no solution should be output.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```In our setting, an instance contains the warehouse layout, representing the floor locations, and in particular their horizontal and vertical relationships; storage locations, where the boxes should eventually go to; and, initial positions of stones and the sokoban. This information is encoded as facts using predicates movedir/3, goal/1, stone/1, isgoal/2, player/1, at/2, clear/2 as follows:\n\nmovedir(x,y,dir): y is a location reachable by location x by moving towards direction dir, where dir can be one of 'dir_up','dir_down','dir_left','dir_right'.\n\ngoal(s): the stone s must be put in a goal location stone(s): s is a stone isgoal(l): l is a goal location isnongoal(l): l is not a goal location. This information can be obtained by complehementing information given by isgoal, but it has been retained for compatibility with the IPC 2011 domain description. player(p): p is the sokoban. at(o,p): the object o (either the sokoban or a stone) is initially at position p. clear(p): the floor location p is clear of objects.\n\nEach instance has exactly one fact for player/1. There can be in principle non-goal stones (i.e. there can be s such that stone(s) holds, but not goal(s)).\n\nAn instance also contains a sequence of time-steps for warehouse configurations, between which the actions occur:\n\nstep(s): s is an allowed step. It can be assumed steps are consecutive integers ranging from 1 towards a limit value N. Steps are associated to actions. It's up to problem modeller's how to treat properly the presence of N+1 intermediate states.```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```The following floor locations are clear of objects: pos_01_06, pos_01_07, pos_01_08, pos_01_09, pos_01_10, pos_01_11, pos_02_02, pos_02_03.

This information is encoded as facts using predicates movedir/3, goal/1, stone/1, isgoal/2, player/1, at/2, clear/2 as follows:\n\nmovedir(x,y,dir): y is a location reachable by location x by moving towards direction dir, where dir can be one of 'dir_up','dir_down','dir_left','dir_right'.\n\ngoal(s): the stone s must be put in a goal location stone(s): s is a stone isgoal(l): l is a goal location isnongoal(l): l is not a goal location. This information can be obtained by complehementing information given by isgoal, but it has been retained for compatibility with the IPC 2011 domain description. player(p): p is the sokoban. at(o,p): the object o (either the sokoban or a stone) is initially at position p. clear(p): the floor location p is clear of objects.\n\nEach instance has exactly one fact for player/1. There can be in principle non-goal stones (i.e. there can be s such that stone(s) holds, but not goal(s)).\n\nAn instance also contains a sequence of time-steps for warehouse configurations, between which the actions occur:\n\nstep(s): s is an allowed step. It can be assumed steps are consecutive integers ranging from 1 towards a limit value N. Steps are associated to actions. It's up to problem modeller's how to treat properly the presence of N+1 intermediate states.```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```Stone stone_02 has to be positioned in a goal location.

{"id": "7101485509754782457", "problem_id": "45", "problem_name": "Sokoban", "description": "Sokoban is a classic problem which appeared so far in all the ASP Competitions. This year the problem specifications were adapted in order to adhere to the specifications of the homologous problem used at IPC 2011 and 2008, in order to achieve a clearer comparative picture between planners and ASP solvers.\nSokoban is a game puzzle developed by the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. in 1982. 'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box). The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations. To this end, the sokoban can walk on floor locations (unless occupied by some box), and push single boxes onto unoccupied floor locations.\nIn the decision version of this problem, the question to answer is whether a solution involving at most N actions exists, for N given as input. If so, a witness containing the sequence of actions should be produced; otherwise no solution should be output.", "format": "In our setting, an instance contains the warehouse layout, representing the floor locations, and in particular their horizontal and vertical relationships; storage locations, where the boxes should eventually go to; and, initial positions of stones and the sokoban. This information is encoded as facts using predicates movedir/3, goal/1, stone/1, isgoal/2, player/1, at/2, clear/2 as follows:\n\nmovedir(x,y,dir): y is a location reachable by location x by moving towards direction dir, where dir can be one of 'dir_up','dir_down','dir_left','dir_right'.\n\ngoal(s): the stone s must be put in a goal location stone(s): s is a stone isgoal(l): l is a goal location isnongoal(l): l is not a goal location. This information can be obtained by complehementing information given by isgoal, but it has been retained for compatibility with the IPC 2011 domain description. player(p): p is the sokoban. at(o,p): the object o (either the sokoban or a stone) is initially at position p. clear(p): the floor location p is clear of objects.\n\nEach instance has exactly one fact for player/1.

This year the problem specifications were adapted in order to adhere to the specifications of the homologous problem used at IPC 2011 and 2008, in order to achieve a clearer comparative picture between planners and ASP solvers.\nSokoban is a game puzzle developed by the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. in 1982. 'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box). The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations. To this end, the sokoban can walk on floor locations (unless occupied by some box), and push single boxes onto unoccupied floor locations.\nIn the decision version of this problem, the question to answer is whether a solution involving at most N actions exists, for N given as input. If so, a witness containing the sequence of actions should be produced; otherwise no solution should be output.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```In our setting, an instance contains the warehouse layout, representing the floor locations, and in particular their horizontal and vertical relationships; storage locations, where the boxes should eventually go to; and, initial positions of stones and the sokoban. This information is encoded as facts using predicates movedir/3, goal/1, stone/1, isgoal/2, player/1, at/2, clear/2 as follows:\n\nmovedir(x,y,dir): y is a location reachable by location x by moving towards direction dir, where dir can be one of 'dir_up','dir_down','dir_left','dir_right'.\n\ngoal(s): the stone s must be put in a goal location stone(s): s is a stone isgoal(l): l is a goal location isnongoal(l): l is not a goal location. This information can be obtained by complehementing information given by isgoal, but it has been retained for compatibility with the IPC 2011 domain description. player(p): p is the sokoban. at(o,p): the object o (either the sokoban or a stone) is initially at position p. clear(p): the floor location p is clear of objects.\n\nEach instance has exactly one fact for player/1. There can be in principle non-goal stones (i.e. there can be s such that stone(s) holds, but not goal(s)).\n\nAn instance also contains a sequence of time-steps for warehouse configurations, between which the actions occur:\n\nstep(s): s is an allowed step.

This year the problem specifications were adapted in order to adhere to the specifications of the homologous problem used at IPC 2011 and 2008, in order to achieve a clearer comparative picture between planners and ASP solvers.\nSokoban is a game puzzle developed by the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. in 1982. 'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box). The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations. To this end, the sokoban can walk on floor locations (unless occupied by some box), and push single boxes onto unoccupied floor locations.\nIn the decision version of this problem, the question to answer is whether a solution involving at most N actions exists, for N given as input. If so, a witness containing the sequence of actions should be produced; otherwise no solution should be output.", "format": "In our setting, an instance contains the warehouse layout, representing the floor locations, and in particular their horizontal and vertical relationships; storage locations, where the boxes should eventually go to; and, initial positions of stones and the sokoban. This information is encoded as facts using predicates movedir/3, goal/1, stone/1, isgoal/2, player/1, at/2, clear/2 as follows:\n\nmovedir(x,y,dir): y is a location reachable by location x by moving towards direction dir, where dir can be one of 'dir_up','dir_down','dir_left','dir_right'.\n\ngoal(s): the stone s must be put in a goal location stone(s): s is a stone isgoal(l): l is a goal location isnongoal(l): l is not a goal location. This information can be obtained by complehementing information given by isgoal, but it has been retained for compatibility with the IPC 2011 domain description. player(p): p is the sokoban. at(o,p): the object o (either the sokoban or a stone) is initially at position p. clear(p): the floor location p is clear of objects.\n\nEach instance has exactly one fact for player/1. There can be in principle non-goal stones (i.e. there can be s such that stone(s) holds, but not goal(s)).\n\nAn instance also contains a sequence of time-steps for warehouse configurations, between which the actions occur:\n\nstep(s): s is an allowed step. It can be assumed steps are consecutive integers ranging from 1 towards a limit value N. Steps are associated to actions. It's up to problem modeller's how to treat properly the presence of N+1 intermediate states.", "text": "Location pos_2_5 can be reached from location pos_1_5 by moving towards direction dir_right.

This year the problem specifications were adapted in order to adhere to the specifications of the homologous problem used at IPC 2011 and 2008, in order to achieve a clearer comparative picture between planners and ASP solvers.\nSokoban is a game puzzle developed by the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. in 1982. 'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box). The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations. To this end, the sokoban can walk on floor locations (unless occupied by some box), and push single boxes onto unoccupied floor locations.\nIn the decision version of this problem, the question to answer is whether a solution involving at most N actions exists, for N given as input. If so, a witness containing the sequence of actions should be produced; otherwise no solution should be output.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```In our setting, an instance contains the warehouse layout, representing the floor locations, and in particular their horizontal and vertical relationships; storage locations, where the boxes should eventually go to; and, initial positions of stones and the sokoban. This information is encoded as facts using predicates movedir/3, goal/1, stone/1, isgoal/2, player/1, at/2, clear/2 as follows:\n\nmovedir(x,y,dir): y is a location reachable by location x by moving towards direction dir, where dir can be one of 'dir_up','dir_down','dir_left','dir_right'.\n\ngoal(s): the stone s must be put in a goal location stone(s): s is a stone isgoal(l): l is a goal location isnongoal(l): l is not a goal location. This information can be obtained by complehementing information given by isgoal, but it has been retained for compatibility with the IPC 2011 domain description. player(p): p is the sokoban. at(o,p): the object o (either the sokoban or a stone) is initially at position p. clear(p): the floor location p is clear of objects.\n\nEach instance has exactly one fact for player/1. There can be in principle non-goal stones (i.e. there can be s such that stone(s) holds, but not goal(s)).\n\nAn instance also contains a sequence of time-steps for warehouse configurations, between which the actions occur:\n\nstep(s): s is an allowed step. It can be assumed steps are consecutive integers ranging from 1 towards a limit value N. Steps are associated to actions. It's up to problem modeller's how to treat properly the presence of N+1 intermediate states.```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```Location pos_2_5 can be reached from location pos_1_5 by moving towards direction dir_right.

This year the problem specifications were adapted in order to adhere to the specifications of the homologous problem used at IPC 2011 and 2008, in order to achieve a clearer comparative picture between planners and ASP solvers.\nSokoban is a game puzzle developed by the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. in 1982. 'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box). The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations. To this end, the sokoban can walk on floor locations (unless occupied by some box), and push single boxes onto unoccupied floor locations.\nIn the decision version of this problem, the question to answer is whether a solution involving at most N actions exists, for N given as input. If so, a witness containing the sequence of actions should be produced; otherwise no solution should be output.", "format": "In our setting, an instance contains the warehouse layout, representing the floor locations, and in particular their horizontal and vertical relationships; storage locations, where the boxes should eventually go to; and, initial positions of stones and the sokoban. This information is encoded as facts using predicates movedir/3, goal/1, stone/1, isgoal/2, player/1, at/2, clear/2 as follows:\n\nmovedir(x,y,dir): y is a location reachable by location x by moving towards direction dir, where dir can be one of 'dir_up','dir_down','dir_left','dir_right'.\n\ngoal(s): the stone s must be put in a goal location stone(s): s is a stone isgoal(l): l is a goal location isnongoal(l): l is not a goal location. This information can be obtained by complehementing information given by isgoal, but it has been retained for compatibility with the IPC 2011 domain description. player(p): p is the sokoban. at(o,p): the object o (either the sokoban or a stone) is initially at position p. clear(p): the floor location p is clear of objects.\n\nEach instance has exactly one fact for player/1. There can be in principle non-goal stones (i.e. there can be s such that stone(s) holds, but not goal(s)).\n\nAn instance also contains a sequence of time-steps for warehouse configurations, between which the actions occur:\n\nstep(s): s is an allowed step.

This year the problem specifications were adapted in order to adhere to the specifications of the homologous problem used at IPC 2011 and 2008, in order to achieve a clearer comparative picture between planners and ASP solvers.\nSokoban is a game puzzle developed by the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. in 1982. 'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box). The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations. To this end, the sokoban can walk on floor locations (unless occupied by some box), and push single boxes onto unoccupied floor locations.\nIn the decision version of this problem, the question to answer is whether a solution involving at most N actions exists, for N given as input. If so, a witness containing the sequence of actions should be produced; otherwise no solution should be output.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```In our setting, an instance contains the warehouse layout, representing the floor locations, and in particular their horizontal and vertical relationships; storage locations, where the boxes should eventually go to; and, initial positions of stones and the sokoban. This information is encoded as facts using predicates movedir/3, goal/1, stone/1, isgoal/2, player/1, at/2, clear/2 as follows:\n\nmovedir(x,y,dir): y is a location reachable by location x by moving towards direction dir, where dir can be one of 'dir_up','dir_down','dir_left','dir_right'.\n\ngoal(s): the stone s must be put in a goal location stone(s): s is a stone isgoal(l): l is a goal location isnongoal(l): l is not a goal location. This information can be obtained by complehementing information given by isgoal, but it has been retained for compatibility with the IPC 2011 domain description. player(p): p is the sokoban. at(o,p): the object o (either the sokoban or a stone) is initially at position p. clear(p): the floor location p is clear of objects.\n\nEach instance has exactly one fact for player/1. There can be in principle non-goal stones (i.e. there can be s such that stone(s) holds, but not goal(s)).\n\nAn instance also contains a sequence of time-steps for warehouse configurations, between which the actions occur:\n\nstep(s): s is an allowed step. It can be assumed steps are consecutive integers ranging from 1 towards a limit value N. Steps are associated to actions. It's up to problem modeller's how to treat properly the presence of N+1 intermediate states.```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```To move from location pos_2_2 to location pos_2_3, go in direction dir_down.

'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box). The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations. To this end, the sokoban can walk on floor locations (unless occupied by some box), and push single boxes onto unoccupied floor locations.\nIn the decision version of this problem, the question to answer is whether a solution involving at most N actions exists, for N given as input.

To this end, the sokoban can walk on floor locations (unless occupied by some box), and push single boxes onto unoccupied floor locations.\nIn the decision version of this problem, the question to answer is whether a solution involving at most N actions exists, for N given as input. If so, a witness containing the sequence of actions should be produced; otherwise no solution should be output.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```In our setting, an instance contains the warehouse layout, representing the floor locations, and in particular their horizontal and vertical relationships; storage locations, where the boxes should eventually go to; and, initial positions of stones and the sokoban. This information is encoded as facts using predicates movedir/3, goal/1, stone/1, isgoal/2, player/1, at/2, clear/2 as follows:\n\nmovedir(x,y,dir): y is a location reachable by location x by moving towards direction dir, where dir can be one of 'dir_up','dir_down','dir_left','dir_right'.\n\ngoal(s): the stone s must be put in a goal location stone(s): s is a stone isgoal(l): l is a goal location isnongoal(l): l is not a goal location. This information can be obtained by complehementing information given by isgoal, but it has been retained for compatibility with the IPC 2011 domain description. player(p): p is the sokoban. at(o,p): the object o (either the sokoban or a stone) is initially at position p. clear(p): the floor location p is clear of objects.\n\nEach instance has exactly one fact for player/1. There can be in principle non-goal stones (i.e. there can be s such that stone(s) holds, but not goal(s)).\n\nAn instance also contains a sequence of time-steps for warehouse configurations, between which the actions occur:\n\nstep(s): s is an allowed step. It can be assumed steps are consecutive integers ranging from 1 towards a limit value N. Steps are associated to actions. It's up to problem modeller's how to treat properly the presence of N+1 intermediate states.```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```By moving in direction dir_down from location pos_1_1, we can arrive at location pos_1_2.

This year the problem specifications were adapted in order to adhere to the specifications of the homologous problem used at IPC 2011 and 2008, in order to achieve a clearer comparative picture between planners and ASP solvers.\nSokoban is a game puzzle developed by the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. in 1982. 'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box). The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations. To this end, the sokoban can walk on floor locations (unless occupied by some box), and push single boxes onto unoccupied floor locations.\nIn the decision version of this problem, the question to answer is whether a solution involving at most N actions exists, for N given as input. If so, a witness containing the sequence of actions should be produced; otherwise no solution should be output.", "format": "In our setting, an instance contains the warehouse layout, representing the floor locations, and in particular their horizontal and vertical relationships; storage locations, where the boxes should eventually go to; and, initial positions of stones and the sokoban. This information is encoded as facts using predicates movedir/3, goal/1, stone/1, isgoal/2, player/1, at/2, clear/2 as follows:\n\nmovedir(x,y,dir): y is a location reachable by location x by moving towards direction dir, where dir can be one of 'dir_up','dir_down','dir_left','dir_right'.\n\ngoal(s): the stone s must be put in a goal location stone(s): s is a stone isgoal(l): l is a goal location isnongoal(l): l is not a goal location. This information can be obtained by complehementing information given by isgoal, but it has been retained for compatibility with the IPC 2011 domain description. player(p): p is the sokoban. at(o,p): the object o (either the sokoban or a stone) is initially at position p. clear(p): the floor location p is clear of objects.\n\nEach instance has exactly one fact for player/1. There can be in principle non-goal stones (i.e. there can be s such that stone(s) holds, but not goal(s)).\n\nAn instance also contains a sequence of time-steps for warehouse configurations, between which the actions occur:\n\nstep(s): s is an allowed step. It can be assumed steps are consecutive integers ranging from 1 towards a limit value N. Steps are associated to actions. It's up to problem modeller's how to treat properly the presence of N+1 intermediate states.", "text": "To travel from location pos_01_08 to location pos_01_07, move towards direction dir_up.

This year the problem specifications were adapted in order to adhere to the specifications of the homologous problem used at IPC 2011 and 2008, in order to achieve a clearer comparative picture between planners and ASP solvers.\nSokoban is a game puzzle developed by the Japanese company Thinking Rabbit, Inc. in 1982. 'Sokoban' means 'warehouse-keeper' in Japanese. Each puzzle consists of a room layout (a number of square fields representing walls or parts of the floor, some of which are marked as storage space) and a starting situation (one sokoban and a number of boxes, all of which must reside on some floor location, where one box occupies precisely one location and each location can hold at most one box). The goal is to move all boxes onto storage locations. To this end, the sokoban can walk on floor locations (unless occupied by some box), and push single boxes onto unoccupied floor locations.\nIn the decision version of this problem, the question to answer is whether a solution involving at most N actions exists, for N given as input. If so, a witness containing the sequence of actions should be produced; otherwise no solution should be output.```\nGiven the following specification for the predicates format: \n```In our setting, an instance contains the warehouse layout, representing the floor locations, and in particular their horizontal and vertical relationships; storage locations, where the boxes should eventually go to; and, initial positions of stones and the sokoban. This information is encoded as facts using predicates movedir/3, goal/1, stone/1, isgoal/2, player/1, at/2, clear/2 as follows:\n\nmovedir(x,y,dir): y is a location reachable by location x by moving towards direction dir, where dir can be one of 'dir_up','dir_down','dir_left','dir_right'.\n\ngoal(s): the stone s must be put in a goal location stone(s): s is a stone isgoal(l): l is a goal location isnongoal(l): l is not a goal location. This information can be obtained by complehementing information given by isgoal, but it has been retained for compatibility with the IPC 2011 domain description. player(p): p is the sokoban. at(o,p): the object o (either the sokoban or a stone) is initially at position p. clear(p): the floor location p is clear of objects.\n\nEach instance has exactly one fact for player/1. There can be in principle non-goal stones (i.e. there can be s such that stone(s) holds, but not goal(s)).\n\nAn instance also contains a sequence of time-steps for warehouse configurations, between which the actions occur:\n\nstep(s): s is an allowed step. It can be assumed steps are consecutive integers ranging from 1 towards a limit value N. Steps are associated to actions. It's up to problem modeller's how to treat properly the presence of N+1 intermediate states.```\nExtract the datalog facts from this text: \n```To travel from location pos_01_08 to location pos_01_07, move towards direction dir_up.
